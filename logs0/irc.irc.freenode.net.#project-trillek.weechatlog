2014-11-21 16:44:08	paultech	you do seem to struggle there
2014-11-21 16:44:20	paultech	Using web client or something?
2014-11-21 16:44:36	paultech	hmm nope
2014-11-21 16:44:39	milesrout	lol, asking then sending a CTCP version.
2014-11-21 16:44:50	paultech	figured it would answer my own question
2014-11-21 16:44:52	milesrout	nah my client doesn't auto-identify for whatever raeson
2014-11-21 16:44:57	paultech	that is odd

2014-11-21 16:46:59	milesrout	seems to be working now
2014-11-21 16:47:22	newguise1234	question, do ya'll like dealing with c++ templates? :)
2014-11-21 16:47:36	milesrout	depends what you mean
2014-11-21 16:47:42	milesrout	eh, what am I kidding, of course I do.
2014-11-21 16:47:45	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-21 16:47:54	newguise1234	I'm trying to stop a recursive generation of templated functions
2014-11-21 16:47:59	newguise1234	http://ideone.com/unM8ao
2014-11-21 16:48:48	newguise1234	just need to find some way to have a specialized function that is run when T==Ptr
2014-11-21 16:49:39	Krarl	That's a really long way to follow pointers for an int
2014-11-21 16:50:00	newguise1234	lol, its only supposed to follow them for 2 recursions in this case
2014-11-21 16:50:04	milesrout	okay so two things.
2014-11-21 16:50:05	newguise1234	but I need a template based stopping point
2014-11-21 16:50:19	Krarl	Haha yeah I know, just thought it looked funny
2014-11-21 16:50:23	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-21 16:50:33	newguise1234	I was taken aback by it the first time I compiled too :p
2014-11-21 16:50:45	milesrout	firstly, you know you need braces around the `if`, if you want everything indented to be part of it, right?
2014-11-21 16:51:00	newguise1234	the tabs were wrong, I fixed it sorry
2014-11-21 16:51:14	newguise1234	thats the stopping point that the templating doesn't take account of
2014-11-21 16:51:18	milesrout	link?
2014-11-21 16:51:25	newguise1234	it wouldn't be neehttp://ideone.com/unM8ao
2014-11-21 16:51:38	milesrout	okay.
2014-11-21 16:52:20	milesrout	now, second thing is within split_array<T, Ptr> you *unconditionally* instantiate split_array<T*, Ptr>
2014-11-21 16:52:43	milesrout	so you're gonna infinite loop as seen in the error message.
2014-11-21 16:53:24	newguise1234	aye, which is why I need a template based solution
2014-11-21 16:53:47	milesrout	yep one second.
2014-11-21 16:54:28	milesrout	firstly, this is the same code with more conventional whitespace. http://ideone.com/rcPU1b
2014-11-21 16:54:34	milesrout	easier to read and easier for me to fix.
2014-11-21 16:58:40	milesrout	hmm this is weird code. so just to confirm, you have a T[n*m*p] and you want a T***?
2014-11-21 17:01:08	newguise1234	I pass in an int* and I want an int***
2014-11-21 17:01:13	newguise1234	yes
2014-11-21 17:01:56	newguise1234	I have it working if there isn't recursion, I just have to call the function a couple times
2014-11-21 17:01:58	paultech	I like my pointers to be like connect the dot game too!
2014-11-21 17:02:03	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-21 17:02:04	paultech	Can draw pictures with the LSB
2014-11-21 17:02:39	newguise1234	I was just trying to get to a general purpose solution
2014-11-21 17:06:32	newguise1234	I just came across this http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/partial_specialization
2014-11-21 17:06:42	Guest59043	MFW I realise I already had hexchat open
2014-11-21 17:06:46	Guest59043	ffs
2014-11-21 17:06:46	newguise1234	and think I might try to utilise that

2014-11-21 17:06:58	milesrout	I had two open lol
2014-11-21 17:07:01	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-21 17:07:04	milesrout	you can't partially specialise function templates
2014-11-21 17:07:14	newguise1234	I could make the function a member fuction
2014-11-21 17:07:16	milesrout	the issue is that you need a base case.
2014-11-21 17:07:31	milesrout	you can overload function template.
2014-11-21 17:07:33	milesrout	*templates
2014-11-21 17:09:31	milesrout	so you want something like this http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/fffeb4e5a35e9212
2014-11-21 17:09:59	milesrout	it still segfaults, probably because your calculations for the pointers are wrong.
2014-11-21 17:10:47	milesrout	what you're trying to do is a bit silly though, you shouldn't do this. better is to write a function or macro that, given i, j, k, returns (i * N * P + j * P + k)
2014-11-21 17:10:56	milesrout	and use that to index into your array.
2014-11-21 17:11:32	newguise1234	yeah, I just got tired of doing index math :/
2014-11-21 17:11:49	milesrout	so you chose to write a template function. haha
2014-11-21 17:11:54	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-21 17:12:09	newguise1234	I thought about saying
2014-11-21 17:12:31	newguise1234	template<typename T, typename... Ptrs, typename fPtr>
2014-11-21 17:12:32	paultech	Purpose should dictate code, whats your usage case for this?
2014-11-21 17:12:38	paultech	Has to be a better method :)
2014-11-21 17:12:42	milesrout	paultech, sometimes code is for fun.
2014-11-21 17:12:58	milesrout	newguise1234, yes it would be MUCH better was a variadic template
2014-11-21 17:13:00	newguise1234	in this case its having a multidimensional array wrapper for my vertex buffer objects
2014-11-21 17:13:10	paultech	Lots of time its fun, still has a purpose unless your just slapping your balls on the keyboard
2014-11-21 17:13:28	milesrout	plenty of things can be fun without having a direct purpose.
2014-11-21 17:13:37	milesrout	e.g. anything even remotely related to brainfuck
2014-11-21 17:13:38	newguise1234	I also figured I'd get more of a handle on templated functions by trying to get this to work
2014-11-21 17:13:46	paultech	like arguing in irc with kids!
2014-11-21 17:13:48	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-21 17:14:02	paultech	not a bad reason newguise1234

2014-11-21 17:34:16	paultech	may of been a engine problem and not vComputer thou

2014-11-21 17:34:37	milesrout	catageek, what have you been writing your code in primarily?
2014-11-21 17:34:52	catageek	I use codeblocks and gcc
2014-11-21 17:34:57	adam4813	Anyone else thinking about taking the compilers course from Stanford?
2014-11-21 17:35:14	milesrout	ah okay. I didn't think gcc was lenient about C++ syntax.
2014-11-21 17:35:32	milesrout	anyway, a 'clang error' is generally an error in the other compilers :P
2014-11-21 17:35:33	catageek	I discover this too.
2014-11-21 17:35:54	catageek	The 'template' thin is a C++03 rule
2014-11-21 17:36:09	milesrout	nope you still need to use it in C++11/14
2014-11-21 17:36:26	milesrout	there are a couple of places where it's now optional but most of the time it's still needed.
2014-11-21 17:37:47	zardoz84	Something I read about it, paultech
2014-11-21 17:37:58	paultech	ok :)
2014-11-21 17:38:04	zardoz84	I didn't write hte code that integrates it on the engine, so I don't know now, what is doing bad

2014-11-21 17:43:15	milesrout	using the most recent version of a library isn't premature optimisation.
2014-11-21 17:43:19	paultech	Bullet has nice multi-threaded solvers, why we needed CL.. ? don't know
2014-11-21 17:43:28	paultech	Bullet3 is very different from Bullet2 milesrout
2014-11-21 17:43:41	milesrout	irrelevant.
2014-11-21 17:43:42	paultech	Not just 'most recent' but 'drastically different'
2014-11-21 17:43:48	paultech	Nope, not engaging you. moving on
2014-11-21 17:43:55	milesrout	lol get fucked.
2014-11-21 17:44:07	zardoz84	adam4813 what exact version ofbullet we are using on the engine ?
2014-11-21 17:44:24	paultech	zardoz, mine builds with bullet 2 from develop branch

2014-11-21 17:44:28	paultech	not sure where bullet3 is coming from
2014-11-21 17:45:09	milesrout	also as you can see from this file, https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/eafbf817c371bf102583f3e50d9639c4d985affc/Demos/VoronoiFractureDemo/VoronoiFractureDemo.cpp#L549
2014-11-21 17:45:13	milesrout	they use very poor RNG.
2014-11-21 17:45:27	zardoz84	I got errors on bullet liberary, when I try to compile it, with bullet 2.82
2014-11-21 17:45:47	adam4813	The max issue is a macro error
2014-11-21 17:46:07	adam4813	Min and max area macros in Win32 for some reason glfw carries them in
2014-11-21 17:46:18	paultech	not into std:: namespace they don't ?
2014-11-21 17:46:28	adam4813	Surround std::min and max with ()
2014-11-21 17:46:34	zardoz84	Also, I'm noticing linking errors ...
2014-11-21 17:46:47	adam4813	The macro gets expanded before namespace resolution
2014-11-21 17:46:51	zardoz84	agg why  developong C++ on windows is a pain in the ass ?
2014-11-21 17:46:57	paultech	hehe
2014-11-21 17:47:11	adam4813	It isn't when that's what you start on
2014-11-21 17:47:18	adam4813	Gotta run good luck
2014-11-21 17:47:49	adam4813	zardoz84: try the latest bullet but I think 2.83 is what I tried
2014-11-21 17:48:03	milesrout	developing ANYTHING on windows is a pain in the arse.
2014-11-21 17:48:06	paultech	2.83 is what im building against
2014-11-21 17:48:28	paultech	and 2.83 should be latest bullet2 version
2014-11-21 17:49:24	zardoz84	miles at least with java is less painful. And I notices that D Lang with DUB got a huge step to make painles
2014-11-21 17:49:35	paultech	Unless we want to enforce a graphics card restriction on desktop and servers > Radeon 7970 || > NVIDIA GTX 680
2014-11-21 17:49:45	paultech	bullet3 has those requirements ^
2014-11-21 17:49:55	paultech	can't use OpenCL CPU target either sadly
2014-11-21 17:50:10	paultech	So has to be a high end graphics card on both desktop/servers. I vote for Bullet2 API ;)

2014-11-21 17:57:24	paultech	Why attempting to use bullet3 Zardoz? They aren't the same API as bullet2 and requires a high end GPU and different solvers
2014-11-21 17:57:40	paultech	Its not just a "new version" of Bullet. its a demonstration of doing physics completely on GPU
2014-11-21 17:57:55	paultech	Bullet 2.8.3 is completely up to date and not superseded by Bullet3
2014-11-21 17:58:30	paultech	You just tell the cmake of bullet not to BUILD_BULLET3
2014-11-21 17:58:48	paultech	If you dont need all the libBullet3* lib and bt3* headers
2014-11-21 17:58:53	milesrout	"high end GPU" I'm not sure I'd call a 7970 a high-end GPU in 2014.
2014-11-21 17:58:57	zardoz84	becasue bullet 2.8.3 has bent fixed yet ! It's from 2013 !
2014-11-21 17:59:15	paultech	milesrout: Agree but my point applies. GPU required
2014-11-21 17:59:18	paultech	Zardoz, whats broken?!
2014-11-21 17:59:30	zardoz84	the  commit that fix the stupid issue with VS2013 is on bullet 3 !
2014-11-21 17:59:34	paultech	That std::min/std::max is bullet3 !
2014-11-21 17:59:38	paultech	You dont need bullet3!
2014-11-21 17:59:52	milesrout	zardoz84, bullet3 is a different codebase, basically.
2014-11-21 17:59:54	paultech	Trillek wont benefit from building bullet3 since it does not link to it or use it
2014-11-21 18:00:11	zardoz84	But but, when I try to build bullet 2.83 I get the  error with std:min/max
2014-11-21 18:00:28	paultech	Well they are (confusingly) being merged into the same git repo but the API is separate and can be built separately
2014-11-21 18:00:37	paultech	You have to uncheck bullet3 form the cmake on bullet2
2014-11-21 18:00:41	paultech	I know :), silly
2014-11-21 18:01:03	<--	milesrout (~milesrout@unaffiliated/milesrout) has left #project-trillek ("Leaving")
2014-11-21 18:01:12	paultech	OPTION(BUILD_BULLET3 "Set when you want to build Bullet 3" ON)
2014-11-21 18:01:26	paultech	Thats included in a Bullet2 download since they are on the same git repo
2014-11-21 18:13:02	adam4813	Min max issues is a Win32 macro issue
2014-11-21 18:14:15	paultech	Pretty sure its just a lack of header define in bullet3 adam
2014-11-21 18:14:31	paultech	I know the MINMAX issue your talking about
2014-11-21 18:16:14	paultech	and infact glfw does define NOMINMAX on windows
2014-11-21 18:16:18	paultech	#ifndef NOMINMAX
2014-11-21 18:16:18	paultech	 #define NOMINMAX
2014-11-21 18:16:18	paultech	#endif
2014-11-21 18:17:14	paultech	Or the hacky () around it method works too

2014-11-21 18:27:15	catageek	paultech: I could build the client but now I have an illegal instruction 'ud2' in bitmap, not immediately but after the initialization of the data.
2014-11-21 18:27:31	catageek	I pushed the commit anyway, you may have more chance.
2014-11-21 18:27:48	catageek	Don't try to build the tests, they fail to build
2014-11-21 18:28:00	paultech	ok
2014-11-21 18:28:17	paultech	you know where that instruction is being generated form?
2014-11-21 18:28:38	paultech	ud2 would be clang crashing on purpose IIRC
2014-11-21 18:28:45	paultech	since its a invalid opcode instruction
2014-11-21 18:28:52	paultech	Maybe you have a << without a return somewhere ?
2014-11-21 18:29:52	catageek	bitmap.hpp:39. Exactly where Clang have a warning

2014-11-21 18:38:12	catageek	the return was in a if statement. gcc let me do this, but clang no

2014-11-21 18:53:40	paultech	Seems to be compiling fine
2014-11-21 18:54:16	paultech	Failed
2014-11-21 18:54:39	paultech	Because my bullet is not double precision so the linker is pissed! I'll fix that :)
2014-11-21 18:54:52	catageek	The issue with the test is probably a problem when moving the map. Since the content is const, it must not be moved element by element. this page is helpful http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/operator%3D
2014-11-21 18:55:03	paultech	Ah

2014-11-21 19:04:45	paultech	do we have shaders loaded anywhere other than assets/shaders ?
2014-11-21 19:07:45	Meisaka	the graphics fixes were never merged in
2014-11-21 19:08:02	paultech	Ah.. cool
2014-11-21 19:08:33	Meisaka	I had fixed how shaders were loaded and built
2014-11-21 19:08:47	paultech	Gotcha, this is due to missing #version
2014-11-21 19:10:01	Meisaka	that is because there items inserted above the #version line before the fix
2014-11-21 19:10:36	paultech	yep ok
2014-11-21 19:10:52	paultech	so wait for catageek to merge into main then your fixes and we should have working osx builds on clang
2014-11-21 19:10:54	paultech	Thats something
2014-11-21 19:13:34	Meisaka	trying to merge my changes into common-core is going to be "fun"

2014-11-22 10:03:43	ChemicalRascal	Yeah, Interstellar is far closer to "classic" sci-fi than the current spectacle stuff. At it's core, IMO, the focus is on the characters rather than spectacle.
2014-11-22 10:07:09	ChemicalRascal	Which is great, of course, because it's faaaaar more valuable to society, art-wise, than another tale of how a party of 4 disparate protagonists went out and beat up the big bad guy, while still having chances to wisecrack at appropriate times.

2014-11-22 14:23:18	ConnorY71	don't worry, I wouldn't do anything even if I did access his account

2014-11-22 14:44:27	ChemicalRascal	paultech, yeah true, but password security is important.
2014-11-22 14:44:55	ChemicalRascal	croxis, please do remember this chan is logged, probably a good idea to rotate anything that shares that password.
2014-11-22 14:45:40	paultech	Oh of course, just not nice to pick on someone for making a mistake that we are all capable of making
2014-11-22 14:45:48	paultech	good call thou forgot about the logging
2014-11-22 14:46:23	danix111	if someone hated within the community does it it's even more tempting
2014-11-22 14:46:28	ScifiSpirit	is there anyone here who doesn't have unique passwords for every service?
2014-11-22 14:46:40	danix111	nobody will admit ever lol
2014-11-22 14:46:42	ChemicalRascal	paultech, this is true, but... Well, Shane did it not only 4 times, but changed his passwords to something that wasn't mp22, *and then changed them back to mp22 later*.
2014-11-22 14:46:44	Meisaka	o/
2014-11-22 14:46:48	paultech	i think my twitter and fb are the same
2014-11-22 14:46:58	danix111	hiya M
2014-11-22 14:47:02	ScifiSpirit	i don't have a single site or service that shares passwords
2014-11-22 14:47:17	paultech	I'm shipping your gold star right now
2014-11-22 14:47:21	ChemicalRascal	I've got a few meaningless accounts that use the same passwords, but mostly everything is randomised, stored in KeePass.
2014-11-22 14:47:24	ScifiSpirit	of course the end result is that i don't remember them :)
2014-11-22 14:47:32	ScifiSpirit	well, most anyway
2014-11-22 14:47:35	danix111	and you end up changing them to one
2014-11-22 14:47:41	paultech	I personally yell binary into my microphone
2014-11-22 14:47:42	ScifiSpirit	i think i remember like 3
2014-11-22 14:48:03	ScifiSpirit	but anything with real password security, yeah, no dice
2014-11-22 14:48:11	ScifiSpirit	like my google account
2014-11-22 14:48:23	ScifiSpirit	you can probably imagine what the password looks like
2014-11-22 14:48:36	danix111	^#&%^(&(#@^&*(## ?
2014-11-22 14:48:45	paultech	length not complexity! :)
2014-11-22 14:48:55	ScifiSpirit	more like Dfjie32kw.-.1.-41m-zx-.3r41,-fasmo12ml?mdio24-64Twew?=!?!#?:D
2014-11-22 14:49:10	paultech	That would be annoying
2014-11-22 14:49:10	danix111	??????????
2014-11-22 14:49:13	ConnorY71	 quick, try nickserv!
2014-11-22 14:49:21	ScifiSpirit	hahah
2014-11-22 14:49:28	paultech	most likely overflow a buffer
2014-11-22 14:49:45	danix111	????????
2014-11-22 14:51:12	paultech	Anyone working on code today?
2014-11-22 14:52:14	danix111	trillek code?
2014-11-22 14:52:38	Meisaka	I'm planning on it
2014-11-22 14:53:52	Meisaka	I want to merge some of my stuff with the common repo, and maybe rewrite my UI system a bit
2014-11-22 14:54:03	danix111	we still want to do web-based UI?
2014-11-22 14:55:06	Meisaka	I am not sure, I want to try writting something custom that only uses the font library directly
2014-11-22 14:55:34	Meisaka	so, I am reading the freetype2 docs
2014-11-22 14:55:40	paultech	Nice
2014-11-22 14:56:14	paultech	I like simple UI's. Ability to load from json for base design would be nice too, then just anchor callbacks/slots/whatever after loading the UI json
2014-11-22 15:32:09	croxis	ChemicalRascal: already done
2014-11-22 15:34:34	 *	ChemicalRascal gives a thumbs-up of approval
2014-11-22 15:35:21	croxis	did right away actually
2014-11-22 15:35:50	croxis	I should use lastpass. hmm

2014-11-22 16:30:51	Meisaka	what kind of link error?
2014-11-22 16:36:02	zardoz84	It keeps trying to link to .lib files that should be generating by bullet it self
2014-11-22 16:37:08	zardoz84	LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file '..\..\..\lib\Debug\LinearMath_Debug.lib'
2014-11-22 16:37:18	zardoz84	and other 3 more like that
2014-11-22 16:37:44	zardoz84	the funny thing is that LinearMath has been compiled previusly, and generated a .dll file
2014-11-22 16:38:13	Meisaka	maybe you should select the build static option in cmake
2014-11-22 16:39:32	Meisaka	also, probably disable the demos as well
2014-11-22 16:45:31	zardoz84	ummmm prebuild.ps compiles with shared libs
2014-11-22 16:45:33	zardoz84	cmake -DINSTALL_LIBS=on -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=on -DBUILD_DEMOS=off -DUSE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=on  .
2014-11-22 16:46:06	Meisaka	don't trust that, it does not work
2014-11-22 16:46:54	zardoz84	I'm trying to fix it at same time that I try to compile trillek-client-core on Windows
2014-11-22 16:47:26	Meisaka	it should probably be building static then
2014-11-22 16:48:08	zardoz84	Also, I got the same problem with trillek-vcomputer-module . I ended doing static compiling to get it working on windows
2014-11-22 16:52:16	zardoz84	Ok bullet is compiled now
2014-11-22 16:52:27	zardoz84	were hell is the include dir with the headers ?
2014-11-22 16:52:49	Meisaka	I think the headers are in the source
2014-11-22 16:53:03	zardoz84	O_o
2014-11-22 16:53:10	Meisaka	so c/cpp/h in the same dirs

2014-11-23 13:57:01	paultech	really need to add some lights to the test level, looks so dark
2014-11-23 14:11:58	danix111	what kind of game is that going to be?
2014-11-23 14:13:50	paultech	Similar to Trillek but focus more on running a station and construction, uses the same vComputer with some changes
2014-11-23 14:14:27	paultech	Got the station generator code, can build corridors/rooms. Basic gas simulation, Can control game objects via vComputer or simple scriptedDevices
2014-11-23 14:14:31	paultech	Fun so far!
2014-11-23 14:23:36	paultech	http://i.imgur.com/GpFYjHb.jpg landed at a planet with a weird floaty debug moon thing
2014-11-23 14:24:53	catageek	Hi paultech, dit you try my branch ?
2014-11-23 14:25:14	paultech	I haven't
2014-11-23 14:25:53	catageek	when does your game will be finished ?
2014-11-23 14:26:31	paultech	Hoping to release a tech build to let people build stations and create parts/programs/wiring within a week
2014-11-23 14:27:05	paultech	Ok your repo builds fine catageek but still crashes on launch due to graphics issues
2014-11-23 14:27:05	catageek	more than us in 1 year...
2014-11-23 14:27:43	paultech	I'm going for quick dev, implement 2 features per weekend and cleanup code over weekdays
2014-11-23 14:28:07	paultech	so its like constant hackathons but it works!
2014-11-23 14:28:14	catageek	how many lines did you write yet ?
2014-11-23 14:28:52	paultech	Not a huge amount, 4k but have everything implemented
2014-11-23 14:29:01	paultech	I also use lots of third party libs rather than implement myself
2014-11-23 14:29:06	paultech	big example being assimp
2014-11-23 14:29:48	paultech	had no problems with it, easy to work with and now have a large range of supported formats for models/textures
2014-11-23 14:29:59	paultech	then bullet and raknet like you guys

2014-11-23 15:30:27	adam4813	but good work so far paultech
2014-11-23 15:30:51	paultech	Thanks!
2014-11-23 15:31:08	adam4813	also writing a model importer isn't that hard
2014-11-23 15:31:19	adam4813	I have written 2 different formats now
2014-11-23 15:31:54	adam4813	BTW I lost my race by 17 minutes last night :(
2014-11-23 15:39:42	adam4813	Ok so I am tinkering with that multiton pattern and I can add components in about 3 lines
2014-11-23 15:40:00	adam4813	well 1 plus the component class/struct definintion
2014-11-23 15:40:52	paultech	Aw @ loss :(
2014-11-23 15:42:59	paultech	My base is coming along! http://i.imgur.com/OvKnppz.jpg
2014-11-23 15:43:41	adam4813	neat
2014-11-23 15:43:51	Meisaka	pretty nice looking
2014-11-23 15:43:58	danix111	quite neat
2014-11-23 15:44:09	paultech	whole platform lower/raises when you press a button linked to a vComputer!
2014-11-23 15:45:56	paultech	now to learn vcomputer asm to make them useful
2014-11-23 15:46:05	paultech	I suppose I need to link against waveasm to compile in-app

2014-11-23 15:46:39	adam4813	And I just added a model matrix component to the engine :)
2014-11-23 15:46:53	adam4813	GUID is just defined as long long
2014-11-23 15:47:01	adam4813	it could be whatver
2014-11-23 15:47:03	paultech	That is cleaner interface
2014-11-23 15:47:30	adam4813	example use case (not thread safe) glUniformMatrix4fv(0, 1, GL_FALSE, &ModelTransformMap::Get(entity_id)->transform[0][0]);
2014-11-23 15:47:43	Meisaka	yay! all my stuff is working
2014-11-23 15:47:47	paultech	ah yes, that read's more like trillek code adam ;)
2014-11-23 15:48:01	adam4813	lol
2014-11-23 15:48:14	adam4813	I am uncertain of that statements meaning, but go on
2014-11-23 15:49:02	paultech	Did come out a bit insulting wasn't meant to be. Just that line doesn't explicitly tell me whats going on without diving ass deep into the code. It's impressive you can abstract so far and still be confusing!
2014-11-23 15:49:33	adam4813	which line is confusing the gluniform...?

2014-11-23 15:50:45	paultech	Not so much confusing as it doesn't spell out to me cleanly whats happening, I can make assumptions based off context but I truly don't know whats happening just by reading that line
2014-11-23 15:50:54	paultech	however reading the header would most likely make that clear
2014-11-23 15:51:24	adam4813	value_type Multiton::Get(key_type);
2014-11-23 15:51:26	paultech	It's not criticism, everyone is welcome to their own style. I just have mine that I'm used too
2014-11-23 15:51:43	adam4813	it is just a wrapper over a static map
2014-11-23 15:51:49	paultech	gotcha
2014-11-23 15:51:59	adam4813	Well numerous static maps
2014-11-23 15:52:02	paultech	like I said, Im sure I could read the header and understand fine. just ignore my blabbing
2014-11-23 15:52:40	paultech	Would be neat to get a working osx build as well
2014-11-23 15:52:42	adam4813	The multiton pattern seems like a good thing as far as ECS is concerned with a central storage and access
2014-11-23 15:52:49	paultech	I'm too far behind on the dev to make repairs
2014-11-23 15:52:51	adam4813	on trillek?
2014-11-23 15:52:54	paultech	yea
2014-11-23 15:52:55	adam4813	or yours?
2014-11-23 15:53:01	paultech	oh no, mines fine
2014-11-23 15:53:25	adam4813	it builds on OSX correct? then it isn't that far behind from being successful :P
2014-11-23 15:53:47	paultech	It does now! :D I think its just Meisaka graphical patches that are needed to run
2014-11-23 15:53:56	adam4813	cool!
2014-11-23 15:53:56	paultech	since its shaders that fail to compile
2014-11-23 15:54:55	Meisaka	you could try feature-common from my fork, which has those
2014-11-23 15:54:58	paultech	whoever is doing UI - http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/GuiUniversalSIGGRAPH08/gui-poster.pdf  http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/GuiUniversalSIGGRAPH08/gui-notes.pdf
2014-11-23 15:55:17	paultech	Been using that method and loving it
2014-11-23 15:55:34	paultech	Also makes it dirt easy to point into scripting vm with universal points since they are by reference
2014-11-23 15:56:10	paultech	I think Trillek already has something similar for pointers
2014-11-23 15:58:01	paultech	http://i.imgur.com/QKNDlLU.jpg crank that bloom!

2014-11-23 16:12:49	paultech	let me try yours
2014-11-23 16:16:26	paultech	So uh confused - I checked out trillek-core then common-core ?
2014-11-23 16:17:15	Meisaka	you should checkout client-core, then update all the submodules

2014-11-24 01:03:58	paultech	cause either of them have textures ;o
2014-11-24 01:04:32	paultech	its also a bad pic due to the test levels lighting

2014-11-24 03:12:29	milesrout	Windows is actually one of the reasons I think minimising dependencies is good
2014-11-24 03:12:43	milesrout	because it's a fucking nightmare building anything with any dependencies on Windows.
2014-11-24 03:12:55	milesrout	let alone building something with like 10-20 dependencies.
2014-11-24 03:13:05	milesrout	there's a reason people ship binaries almost exclusively on Windows
2014-11-24 03:31:35	zardoz84	Well, M$ is going to add a package manager to the next version of Windows
2014-11-24 03:31:51	zardoz84	but now, you can get a taste of it with chocolatey and nuget
2014-11-24 03:35:11	zardoz84	I'm taking a look to this : https://github.com/AdrianArroyoCalle/skeleton-cpp-game
2014-11-24 03:38:08	zardoz84	I going to ask him. Also, he is spanish :D
2014-11-24 03:38:42	milesrout	they already have an app store
2014-11-24 03:40:40	milesrout	oh you mean a real package manager?
2014-11-24 03:40:42	milesrout	holy shit Microsoft
2014-11-24 03:41:03	milesrout	you're over 20 years behind but somehow this is still impressing people.
2014-11-24 03:46:22	zardoz84	xD
2014-11-24 03:48:22	zardoz84	If someday they decided to support a good moderm file system, like EXT4 or BTRFS ... no, we must work over a a FS that could take a drink.
2014-11-24 03:50:27	zardoz84	Hey, what do you think about this lib ? http://www.portaudio.com/
2014-11-24 03:59:32	zardoz84	It's actively developed, at contrary that openal, ans for what I can see, it does the same thing that does openal + alure

2014-11-24 04:44:52	milesrout	:P
2014-11-24 04:45:03	milesrout	1 dependency is better than two.
2014-11-24 04:45:10	milesrout	two = more work building
2014-11-24 04:45:18	zardoz84	:P
2014-11-24 04:45:19	milesrout	does it do 3D audio like OpenAL?
2014-11-24 04:46:09	zardoz84	The only problem that I see with portaudio, is that is low level
2014-11-24 04:46:09	zardoz84	I don't see stuff to do 3d audio like OpenAL
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	yeah that could be problematic
2014-11-24 04:49:13	zardoz84	but there is a wrap library over it that  gives these kind of functionality (https://code.google.com/p/yse-soundengine/)
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	2 = 2
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	:P
2014-11-24 04:49:13	zardoz84	so we would end having two depencienes in any case
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	yeah and then you have a problem of using two little-known libraries rather than two well-known libraries.
2014-11-24 04:49:13	zardoz84	Perhaps I could try it aparth
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	?
2014-11-24 04:49:13	zardoz84	well portaudio isn't  a little-know lib
2014-11-24 04:49:13	zardoz84	It's being used in a VLC and Audacity
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	oh it is?
2014-11-24 04:49:13	milesrout	nvm then
2014-11-24 04:50:56	zardoz84	I would try it to see if it worth the effort
2014-11-24 04:54:00	zardoz84	humm yse + portaudio supports audio occlusion and does automatic doppler effect

2014-11-24 05:28:46	milesrout	zardoz84, there's absolutely NOTHING wrong with Boost
2014-11-24 05:30:05	zardoz84	I rememeber that when we begin, there is some discussion about avoiding using boost because would end needing loading half boost library to use any thing of it.
2014-11-24 05:30:22	milesrout	Boost is a bit big for a small program, but a game engine? c'mon
2014-11-24 05:30:28	zardoz84	Personally, I not used it yet, so I can't say anything about it
2014-11-24 05:31:12	zardoz84	For what I saw on yse, they are using a boost map for pointers
2014-11-24 05:39:10	milesrout	which map?

2014-11-24 05:47:31	milesrout	ptr_container is a bit... dated
2014-11-24 05:58:35	zardoz84	I think that there is a lot of changes .. I can't file these file
2014-11-24 06:00:11	zardoz84	but looks that now isn't using anymore boost
2014-11-24 06:00:11	milesrout	ah well that's good I suppose
2014-11-24 06:00:33	milesrout	although any excuse to get Boost onto the dependencies list is great by me: you barely need anything else :P
2014-11-24 06:01:24	zardoz84	For what I'm seeing, now yse relays on juice to be independent fo the audio backend ... interesting

2014-11-24 16:26:48	Meisaka	find_library is only supposed to .lib files, because a dll is never linked directly in windows.
2014-11-24 16:27:06	Meisaka	*to find
2014-11-24 16:28:18	zardoz84	so, on windows should only search for the include file

2014-11-24 16:29:55	zardoz84	but not fail. Alure on windows not have a .lib

2014-11-25 08:18:13	ScifiSpirit	that is great discussion about networking and prediction in that latter link
2014-11-25 08:18:33	ScifiSpirit	everything makes sense to me, except this "This causes some temporal anomalies, for example, players can shoot you around corners because they see your position 100ms in the past. However, most players seem to prefer this over having to constantly shoot ahead of their targets to compensate for prediction errors"
2014-11-25 08:19:12	ScifiSpirit	or actually this: "...having to constantly shoot ahead of their targets to compensate for prediction errors."
2014-11-25 08:21:33	zardoz84	When I first played multiplayer games over internet, I had a 1Gbit connection and was with games like Unreal Tournament that had a "modern" netcode. I never had serius issues, if I connect against a european server.
2014-11-25 08:22:38	zardoz84	Later I begun to play ZDaemon (Doom source port), Battlefield 2114, StarCraft, etc...
2014-11-25 08:23:38	zardoz84	There was other article on reddit or ycombinator about how was developed XWing vs TIE-Fighter, and on particular his net code, if I can find it...
2014-11-25 08:34:20	ScifiSpirit	1. The terms. Usually "prediction" means client-side prediction, which only affects the local player and has little to do with aiming and shooting at targets. Or that's the core concept of it. And i believe they refer to the kind of "prediction" that allows players to shoot directly at targets without leading as "lag compensation".
2014-11-25 08:34:20	ScifiSpirit	2. The whole point of any kind of prediction or compensation is that the player doesn't have to compensate, so "shooting ahead" doesn't make much sense in that sense.
2014-11-25 08:34:20	ScifiSpirit	3. Player cannot predict the kind of prediction error anyway, so it's not necessarily ahead, that they should constantly compensate, it could also be any other direction.
2014-11-25 08:36:52	ScifiSpirit	so, the players aren't compensating against prediction error, but lag, is what he meant?
2014-11-25 08:38:56	ScifiSpirit	also this link http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/what-every-programmer-needs-to-know-about-game-networking/ gives me Forbidden 403
2014-11-25 08:39:01	ScifiSpirit	would have liked to read it

2014-11-25 11:56:58	paultech	ScifiSpirit:  Normally you do the simulation on the sever and the client only experiences a close approximation of the state of the simulation when talking particle physics
2014-11-25 11:57:23	paultech	There is no benefit to sending all the data required for exact deterministic simulation on the client
2014-11-25 11:57:54	paultech	So you send the smallest amount of data required for the client to render the information
2014-11-25 12:03:43	zardoz84	I will need to hurry up with the firmware.
2014-11-25 12:04:00	paultech	:D yes!
2014-11-25 12:04:02	zardoz84	At least to allow some kind of interaction with the player
2014-11-25 12:04:39	zardoz84	So we could see if the virtual computer works well across a internet connection

2014-11-25 12:34:21	paultech	I'm testing mine with bullet. Clientside bullet has all static objects, serverside bullet has the rigid bodies and it sends delta changes to the client for bullet to apply to the static bullies
2014-11-25 12:35:18	paultech	So far its not too shabby but will need some clientside forces such as gravity simulated to get a accurate simulation between delta's.. or else objects stop falling during latency ;)
2014-11-25 12:35:29	paultech	clientside prediction, serverside correction
2014-11-25 12:36:18	zardoz84	But with the virtual computer...
2014-11-25 12:36:35	zardoz84	the idea was doing something similar to VNC or NX
2014-11-25 12:36:44	zardoz84	get input from the player/user
2014-11-25 12:37:02	zardoz84	and send deltas of the screen and generated sound
2014-11-25 12:38:07	zardoz84	but it would enought ? Or would be necessary to run on the client side, an instance of a computer and overwrite his state based on what says the server ?
2014-11-25 12:40:46	paultech	Man, you can't say 'network in general' then switch to vComputer :P two different topics that need very different strategy!

2014-11-25 12:42:48	paultech	It's interesting question really. I like the VNC method as it leaves the client up to its most important job, rendering while the server can be efficient at executing en mass with a very strict set of data that requires syncing - thats nice. Plus the only downside is latency and that won't be too noticeable on the type of displays we are talking about
2014-11-25 12:48:21	zardoz84	nx does much better that vnc.
2014-11-25 12:49:16	zardoz84	but it's does something very similar, with a very clever cache, and avoiding unnecessary waits on the x protocol
2014-11-25 12:50:10	zardoz84	The result is very impressive, giving a feeling of running on local something that is behind an 1 Mbit ADSL at 500 km
2014-11-25 12:51:27	zardoz84	also, it could work much better, if you only run a xterm, and launch graphical programs from it, avoiding the need to keep on sync a full desktop
2014-11-25 12:55:08	paultech	zzzz overcomplicated
2014-11-25 12:56:08	paultech	our current state is a blinking cursor requiring syncing, lets take it easy on x protocol implementation being involved in our network stack
2014-11-25 12:56:29	paultech	or we'll end up with a network server that looks like bitmap.hpp

2014-11-25 12:59:08	zardoz84	blinking could be done on the client side, only is necesary to send if the blinking is enabled or not
2014-11-25 12:59:23	paultech	Yep, in the smallest possible amount of data. It would be nice maybe for devices like SerialConsole to have localecho for keyboard so you get instant feedback but even that is not something needed in the first iteration of the code

2014-11-26 07:25:22	zardoz84	About coments :
2014-11-26 07:25:23	zardoz84	Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW.
2014-11-26 07:25:23	zardoz84	Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the
2014-11-26 07:25:23	zardoz84	function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it,
2014-11-26 07:25:23	zardoz84	you should probably go back to chapter 6 for a while.  You can make
2014-11-26 07:25:23	zardoz84	small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or
2014-11-26 07:25:24	zardoz84	ugly), but try to avoid excess.  Instead, put the comments at the head
2014-11-26 07:25:24	zardoz84	of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does
2014-11-26 07:25:25	zardoz84	it.

2014-11-27 13:24:46	zardoz84	Happy thanksgiving
2014-11-27 13:25:08	zardoz84	Here only is a normal Thor's day
2014-11-27 13:25:12	croxis	speaking of i need to shower and start cooking soon
2014-11-27 13:27:43	paultech	Thanks all! croxis been hectic here already with the cooking but smelling amazing
2014-11-27 13:27:50	croxis	:)
2014-11-27 13:27:54	croxis	we do it potluck style
2014-11-27 13:28:03	croxis	I just have to make my rolls
2014-11-27 13:28:12	paultech	Oh that's awesome idea
2014-11-27 13:28:44	paultech	zardoz84: what os do you run normally ?
2014-11-27 13:28:57	zardoz84	Depends
2014-11-27 13:29:14	zardoz84	If I'm going to play, usually i'm on Windows, if not I'm on GNU/Linux
2014-11-27 13:29:32	zardoz84	In other words, I use Linux for serius stuff :D
2014-11-27 13:29:47	zardoz84	66% of time on Linux
2014-11-27 13:29:51	paultech	I got some basic networking and remote (webgl) rendering into my engine last night but im having a problem with vcomputers (not sync at all) and wanted to put out a build for you to test with. wont have time today but can build tomorrow after family leaves
2014-11-27 13:29:53	croxis	more and more games are on linux now, can't keep it just for serious stuff for much longer :P
2014-11-27 13:30:12	zardoz84	Yep
2014-11-27 13:30:16	zardoz84	I have steam on Linux
2014-11-27 13:30:42	zardoz84	But the game that actually I play more, (Robocraft and Sword of Stars) runs only on Windows :(
2014-11-27 13:30:43	paultech	i dont have steamworks integrated in this one, I'd need to sign paperwork with bosses to get a appid and dont want to go that route
2014-11-27 13:30:51	croxis	robocraft is on linux
2014-11-27 13:30:59	paultech	so should I build for win or linux zardoz?
2014-11-27 13:31:00	zardoz84	with wine, not ?
2014-11-27 13:31:04	croxis	no, native
2014-11-27 13:31:24	zardoz84	What would be  more easy for you ?
2014-11-27 13:32:53	paultech	Hmm, I have vm's of both locally here and it should all be pretty cross platform already. I guess if I do a windows build more people in here can try it out at same time
2014-11-27 13:33:41	zardoz84	Strange, I dont see Robocraft on my list of games on Steam
2014-11-27 13:33:41	Meisaka	except those who use linux more
2014-11-27 13:34:07	croxis	oh, i think its something to do with being a free game, i had the issue before
2014-11-27 13:34:57	paultech	Meisaka: once I have everything feature-semi-ish-alphaish I'll setup a build system for all three
2014-11-27 13:35:18	paultech	its all under cmake so its been easy enough to build so far
2014-11-27 13:37:18	zardoz84	croxis:  How do you fix these issue ?
2014-11-27 13:37:32	croxis	i think i just readded it fromthe store page
2014-11-27 13:40:39	zardoz84	Oh. I see it
2014-11-27 13:40:48	zardoz84	Ok, now my productivity would drop a lot

2014-11-28 15:17:06	Meisaka	The Trillek engine is custom made to support computers and the large-ness of space and so on
2014-11-28 15:18:02	ralian	Well yeah, but you have to be using some sort of library
2014-11-28 15:18:08	ralian	Even if it is just pure openGL
2014-11-28 15:19:12	Meisaka	The are a number of smaller supporting libraries, but still none of those make it a "game"
2014-11-28 15:19:33	ralian	So, what's your supporting graphics, sound, and physics libraries?
2014-11-28 15:20:27	Meisaka	Graphics/OS is glew+glfw3, sound is ALure+OpenAL, physics so far is bullet
2014-11-28 15:20:42	ralian	Okay
2014-11-28 15:21:19	ralian	That's a good choice. How far are we in the code?
2014-11-28 15:21:43	Meisaka	"how far" is subjective
2014-11-28 15:21:53	ralian	What has been done?
2014-11-28 15:23:13	ralian	Actually, if you could just link me to the official repository that would be great
2014-11-28 15:23:45	ralian	Nah, I found the github, it's all cool
2014-11-28 15:23:56	Meisaka	well, the engine can load stuff, make simple entities with various aspects, computers are in as a demo, scripting is working, I could maybe go on...
2014-11-28 15:24:44	ralian	You could go on.
2014-11-28 15:25:45	Meisaka	I made a UI system, but that is not merged in, and may change.
2014-11-28 15:26:09	ralian	Oh, so a GUI library?
2014-11-28 15:26:37	ralian	GUI libraries tend to be very tedious
2014-11-28 15:26:47	Meisaka	yes, the system I made is based on libRocket
2014-11-28 15:26:47	ralian	So that's good
2014-11-28 15:26:56	ralian	huh
2014-11-28 15:28:10	ralian	There are a ton of files, but github says there are only 8 commits x)
2014-11-28 15:28:20	ralian	I'm probably doing something wrong
2014-11-28 15:28:30	Meisaka	wrong branch maybe
2014-11-28 15:28:38	ralian	Yes, wrong branch.
2014-11-28 15:28:46	ralian	Nevermind.
2014-11-28 15:28:58	ralian	Github is nice.
2014-11-28 15:29:09	H1N1theI|Cloud	Meisaka: libRocket doesn't do JS though. :P
2014-11-28 15:29:23	Meisaka	don't need no JS, lua ftw
2014-11-28 15:29:34	ralian	Lua ftw indeed.
2014-11-28 15:29:41	H1N1theI|Cloud	Meisaka: You know, Awesomium 1.8 is going to allow you to bind directly to the V8 engine.
2014-11-28 15:29:45	H1N1theI|Cloud	Which I'm hyped about.
2014-11-28 15:29:48	H1N1theI|Cloud	Fuck lua.
2014-11-28 15:29:51	H1N1theI|Cloud	Angelscript. :U
2014-11-28 15:30:08	ralian	Are we using selene for lua?
2014-11-28 15:30:18	Meisaka	Awesomium is 1.8GB
2014-11-28 15:30:30	Meisaka	lua is just lua
2014-11-28 15:30:31	ralian	I only ever liked lua because it was so easy to bind to c
2014-11-28 15:30:31	H1N1theI|Cloud	Meisaka: Em, no.
2014-11-28 15:30:59	ralian	Are we using selene, or have we done that yet?
2014-11-28 15:31:11	Meisaka	or am I thinking of the other thing.
2014-11-28 15:31:13	H1N1theI|Cloud	Meisaka: Awesomium is only 80 mbs built.
2014-11-28 15:31:22	H1N1theI|Cloud	You might be thinking of something else.
2014-11-28 15:32:05	ralian	What can I do to help Trillek?
2014-11-28 15:32:19	H1N1theI|Cloud	ralian: Write code, pull request. :P
2014-11-28 15:32:21	ralian	It looks like there was a lot of work being done this summer, but then work trailed off
2014-11-28 15:32:33	ralian	Well yeah, but what code needs written?
2014-11-28 15:32:59	H1N1theI|Cloud	ralian: I have no idea, haven't kept up.
2014-11-28 15:33:04	H1N1theI|Cloud	ralian: But there's always something to be done.
2014-11-28 15:33:07	Meisaka	hmm...
2014-11-28 15:34:03	Meisaka	I know there are existing things that need fixing/improvement
2014-11-28 15:36:18	ralian	lIke?
2014-11-28 15:36:35	ralian	And yes, cloud, such is the nature of the development industry.
2014-11-28 15:37:39	H1N1theI|Cloud	ralian: Yes. EVERYDAY IS PATCH THURSDAY WHEN YOU'RE WRITING THEM.
2014-11-28 15:37:40	H1N1theI|Cloud	:U
2014-11-28 15:38:02	ralian	Yes.
2014-11-28 15:38:41	Meisaka	the virtual computers in the engine don't have stable clock speeds, the logging system has yet to write to files, there is no object parenting
2014-11-28 15:39:04	Meisaka	my UI system isn't merged ;)
2014-11-28 15:39:12	ralian	No object parenting as in it's just disorganized?
2014-11-28 15:39:27	ralian	Or do you actually want a parent object that counts references?
2014-11-28 15:40:13	Meisaka	the transform of objects is always absolute, but a relative transform is often needed
2014-11-28 15:40:29	Meisaka	that is what I mean by parenting
2014-11-28 15:40:53	ralian	Oh, jesus
2014-11-28 15:41:08	ralian	Meisaka, that's kind of a necessary thing
2014-11-28 15:41:31	Meisaka	that partially has to do with the recent rewrite to how tranforms work
2014-11-28 15:41:55	ralian	Hm
2014-11-28 15:42:18	ralian	Also, working with operating system timers is a bitch
2014-11-28 15:43:46	Meisaka	the OS timers are fairly well abstracted, but engine systems are multithreaded and asynchonous of the frame display
2014-11-28 15:44:54	Meisaka	I know the engine is still in need of a good messaging layer to report changes between systems
2014-11-28 15:45:22	ralian	I see.
2014-11-28 15:47:39	ralian	Can you tell me more about the design documents that were uploaded on reddit about a month ago?
2014-11-28 15:48:18	Meisaka	about a month ago was a ton of drama, in which nothing got done
2014-11-28 15:50:03	ralian	I see
2014-11-28 15:50:30	ralian	Do you agree with the design documents?
2014-11-28 15:51:17	Meisaka	TBH, I don't know if I even read any or not
2014-11-28 15:51:55	ralian	Thank you, sweet baby jesus
2014-11-28 15:52:13	ralian	They were kind of a mess and they scared me away for awhile
2014-11-28 15:56:47	ralian	I'm no god-programmer, but I think I can get logging serializable
2014-11-28 15:57:10	ralian	And transforms O_o
2014-11-28 15:57:51	Meisaka	The existing logging system (which I wrote) is designed so that it should be easy to make it write out to a file
2014-11-28 15:58:42	ralian	Oh, I thought you said that wasn't done yet
2014-11-28 15:59:03	Meisaka	there is a logging system, but just writes to console
2014-11-28 15:59:34	ralian	Ah yes, I am looking at it now
2014-11-28 15:59:56	ralian	Oh, you said it just needs file output
2014-11-28 16:00:02	ralian	I thought it needed a complete overhaul
2014-11-28 16:03:15	Meisaka	hmm, I wonder why does everyone assumes that in discussions about the logging system...
2014-11-28 16:03:47	ralian	lol, was I not the first one?
2014-11-28 16:04:07	ralian	I hadn't looked at it yet, but it looks well written now that I have it in front of me
2014-11-28 16:04:18	Meisaka	nope, and probably will not be that last unless it gets finished
2014-11-28 16:04:49	ralian	I suppose you get people like me everyday on the irc x)
2014-11-28 16:05:03	Meisaka	well, every few weeks maybe
2014-11-28 16:05:27	ralian	Well, I'd love to help
2014-11-28 16:06:11	ralian	I was really sad about 0x10c, and I never got involved in trillek
2014-11-28 16:06:41	ralian	Forked.
2014-11-28 16:09:01	ralian	Also, how far along is the server?
2014-11-28 16:09:30	ralian	I assume we are just going to run a local instance of the server in single player?
2014-11-28 16:10:55	catageek	hi
2014-11-28 16:10:57	catageek	yes
2014-11-28 16:11:11	Meisaka	the server (and networking in general) are not very far along at all. The client is being designed to handle it though
2014-11-28 16:12:25	-->	paultech (~paultech@66.211.20.74) has joined #project-trillek
2014-11-28 16:12:39	ralian	I see.
2014-11-28 16:29:32	ralian	Wait, what build system are we using?
2014-11-28 16:29:40	paultech	cmake
2014-11-28 16:31:39	ralian	I don't see a configure script
2014-11-28 16:31:49	ralian	or makefiles
2014-11-28 16:32:30	Meisaka	if you've never used cmake before, it generates them
2014-11-28 16:32:45	Meisaka	read up on cmake, it'll help
2014-11-28 16:32:53	ralian	Aha.
2014-11-28 16:33:10	ralian	I understand make, I've never had to use cmake before.
2014-11-28 16:33:32	ralian	lol, I guess that speaks to my level of experience.
2014-11-28 16:33:48	Meisaka	cmake is kind of like a configure script, but multiplatorm
2014-11-28 16:34:10	ralian	I see.
2014-11-28 16:35:21	Meisaka	it makes working with different tool chains, OSes, and IDEs so much easier
2014-11-28 16:35:58	ralian	Yes, that is for the best then
2014-11-28 16:42:16	ralian	Could you help me by telling me why there is no cmakelists in the trillek-common repository?
2014-11-28 16:45:43	Meisaka	the top level one in client handles all that
2014-11-28 16:45:45	paultech	cause trillek-common is just code shared between projects. Get trillek-client-core and submodule
2014-11-28 16:46:05	paultech	Meisaka would have better advice than me. I'm a rather cmake noob

2014-11-28 16:52:33	Meisaka	logs.trillek.org
2014-11-28 16:52:51	ralian	Anyways, I see that now, but shouldn't the core have its own build system too?
2014-11-28 16:52:57	ralian	Sorry, the common?
2014-11-28 16:53:25	ralian	And yes, I forked four of the repositories
2014-11-28 16:55:21	Meisaka	the common repo alone does not build to anything, it is just shared code
2014-11-28 16:56:28	ralian	Objects still need to be built from the .cpp files, whether they are put into archives or shared object files, right?
2014-11-28 16:56:49	paultech	Well thats a confusing way to word that question
2014-11-28 16:57:08	ralian	I was under the impression that trillek-common was treated as its own library
2014-11-28 16:57:23	paultech	Nope
2014-11-28 16:57:28	ralian	And yes, I have been known to make simple things confusing. Sorry.
2014-11-28 16:57:30	paultech	Its not linked, its compiled into trillek-client-core
2014-11-28 16:57:46	ralian	Ah, that clears things up
2014-11-28 16:57:50	paultech	If you get trillek-client-core - Its dependency is trillek-common
2014-11-28 16:58:01	ralian	But you'd think we would want it to be linked, to save space
2014-11-28 16:58:11	paultech	It could be done in a library format like you said but it was selected just to share the code
2014-11-28 16:58:16	ralian	Since it is used in trillek-client-core and trillek-server-core
2014-11-28 16:58:21	paultech	Eh linker takes up more space than compiled in objects :)
2014-11-28 16:58:30	paultech	but client ad server aren't the same project :)
2014-11-28 16:58:37	paultech	you wont get a binary that acts as client and server
2014-11-28 16:58:59	paultech	So its infact opposite, your binary is smaller in size since it only has its required symbols
2014-11-28 16:59:16	ralian	paul: Yes, but common is used in client and server, correct?
2014-11-28 16:59:36	ralian	paul: Also, in this case it is smaller just to compile it in is my guess. Not so in many cases.
2014-11-28 17:00:14	ralian	paul: But I guess I do see why we aren't just making that a library
2014-11-28 17:03:59	Meisaka	it is far easier for the build configuration to just recursively add the common files and build them, than to go through the trouble of ensuring common builds to a library.
2014-11-28 17:04:01	paultech	serves the same function as a library. We just don't intend so allow others to link to it so why use a external library? It's about the one thing Trillek does simple/clean ;)

2014-11-28 17:15:25	ralian	In theory, If I just git the repositories, prebuild, and then build, it should work, right?
2014-11-28 17:15:31	ralian	Prebuild worked fine
2014-11-28 17:15:50	ralian	Build gives me an error with the cmake cache
2014-11-28 17:16:08	ralian	and then obviously generates no makefile
2014-11-28 17:17:56	Meisaka	you do need all the deps installed as well
2014-11-28 17:19:30	ralian	I have all the dependancies installed
2014-11-28 17:19:39	ralian	I think it's actually a problem with how I configured cmake
2014-11-28 17:21:27	paultech	ralian: Care to share the error or is it a secret ?
2014-11-28 17:22:47	ralian	If you might help me, then sure x)
2014-11-28 17:25:30	ralian	Cmake hits an error (it says could not find or load file) on this line: INCLUDE(SetCompilerFlags)
2014-11-28 17:28:18	paultech	Not to be rude, but are you a developer? The game is not in a usable state and you wont get any real usable content after building. If your building in an attempt to play the game - you will be sad. If your compiling in order to contribute I'd be happy to help out!
2014-11-28 17:28:45	paultech	Notice you only have to download one repo - You said you 'git the repositories, prebuild'
2014-11-28 17:29:17	paultech	A) Only one repo. Run git submodule update --init common in top level of client-core - Instructions are on the github page
2014-11-28 17:29:55	paultech	Oh I've never used that prebuild.sh
2014-11-28 17:30:01	paultech	It looks incomplete, I wouldn't use it
2014-11-28 17:30:08	ralian	Oh
2014-11-28 17:30:16	ralian	And, yes, I plan on helping to develop

2014-11-28 17:31:35	paultech	What OS you building on btw?
2014-11-28 17:31:38	paultech	Will make it easier to help
2014-11-28 17:31:42	ralian	Ah, I now see that the resources module should be linked inside the core client repository
2014-11-28 17:31:48	ralian	Linux, debian
2014-11-28 17:31:56	paultech	Oh ok, you should have a easy time of building
2014-11-28 17:32:05	paultech	follow the steps and use cmake-gui if you have it
2014-11-28 17:32:17	paultech	a GUI will help you correct errors as it has nice highlighting
2014-11-28 17:32:24	ralian	I don't have the gui, but it looks like the console has an interactive mode
2014-11-28 17:32:27	paultech	if your headless cmake is the same
2014-11-28 17:32:29	paultech	Yep
2014-11-28 17:33:01	Meisaka	ccmake is a gui like console version
2014-11-28 17:33:16	ralian	Okay, I'll take a look at that
2014-11-28 17:33:32	ralian	GUI is usually easier to begin with
2014-11-28 17:40:40	ralian	Out of curiosity, why did you guys choose way back just to pretty much build trillek up from scratch instead of going with a more complete solution?
2014-11-28 17:42:34	Meisaka	licensing mainly
2014-11-28 17:43:42	ralian	There are more complete free solutions.
2014-11-28 17:45:56	Meisaka	there is a different between free and "free"

2014-11-28 17:57:45	ralian	paultech: You're right about prebuild.sh, it didn't install all the dependancies I needed
2014-11-28 18:01:19	paultech	Meisaka: My answer to his question would of been that requirements of Trillek would function best under our own engine thats designed for the task of simulating vComputers
2014-11-28 18:01:28	paultech	Fuck licensing excuse :)
2014-11-28 18:01:54	ralian	True.
2014-11-28 18:03:10	Meisaka	well, I think it also has to do with: multiplatform development, ease of integrating the computers, and finding good options available that also fit the code license
2014-11-28 18:03:43	paultech	so some middle ground between our two answers ralian ;)
2014-11-28 18:05:04	paultech	Everyone knows my views on Trillek source code. Largely over engineered but never badly engineered, some very skilled developers on the project but I feel they spend too much time not only reinventing the wheel but the chisel, nail, bolts that go with it is excessive and causing large delays in producing a actual game
2014-11-28 18:05:19	paultech	You guys are getting close to completion on a engine, not started on game yet
2014-11-28 18:05:27	paultech	But extremely skilled devs! :)
2014-11-28 18:06:07	paultech	I ran the source code thru the dev side of the house and most had the same view of heavily engineered solutions to simple problems but overwise good code quality!

2014-11-28 18:08:50	scybot	milesrout: darkspartan was last seen 4 weeks ago saying: Now it's after midnight here, and I need to be up in six. Good. night
2014-11-28 18:08:52	milesrout	literally a month
2014-11-28 18:09:18	Meisaka	a month without drama, and stuff actually happens
2014-11-28 18:09:38	paultech	bet if we do that constantly untill it says one month we can get the timezone of scybot. Information leak exploit!
2014-11-28 18:10:41	ralian	Yeah, what I have seen so far is quite some wheel reinvention
2014-11-28 18:10:45	ralian	but it's a good wheel
2014-11-28 18:10:49	paultech	Meisaka: It's been rather impressive to see the increase in productivity, also makes it bearable to hang out in here. Least the drama queens are easy to spot
2014-11-28 18:11:29	paultech	ralian: That's just my view as a not-as-skilled dev but someone thats been in the field for some time. Take it with a grain of salt
2014-11-28 18:11:48	ralian	right :)
2014-11-28 18:12:08	ralian	I'm the same way, but without the field experience
2014-11-28 18:12:34	paultech	I'm also developing a hobby game similar to Trillek but I assure you if the two games source were submitted for academic review, Trillek would win!
2014-11-28 18:12:54	ralian	Actually, same here.
2014-11-28 18:13:04	paultech	Nice!
2014-11-28 18:13:39	ralian	One might call it Trillek without computers, and I was doing it on irrlicht
2014-11-28 18:14:11	ralian	Never did get far.
2014-11-28 18:14:25	ralian	But it was fun! And I got something out of it.
2014-11-28 18:14:51	paultech	http://i.imgur.com/yWND2WJ.png http://i.imgur.com/14qBVZQ.jpg http://i.imgur.com/OvKnppz.jpg seems screens from this weeks dev
2014-11-28 18:15:53	ralian	Woah! What software did you use to create it?
2014-11-28 18:16:37	paultech	It's my own engine as well
2014-11-28 18:17:04	ralian	Wow. That's even more impressive.
2014-11-28 18:17:32	paultech	Just a different development plan, focus around features of the engine that I was currently making content so things appear to move at a much more fast pace, good for motivation. Trillek when it switches from engine dev to game dev will overtake my efforts most likely
2014-11-28 18:19:11	ralian	Yeah - I'm not planning to drop my game yet. I like some of the ideas I began implementing that weren't in Trillek, although I like the idea of trillek better overall.
2014-11-28 18:19:31	paultech	Finished up the scene file format as well - http://hastebin.com/isaruxoriv.avrasm example of the computer and the rocket
2014-11-28 18:19:47	paultech	I use the trillek-vcomputer in my project
2014-11-28 18:20:09	ralian	Nice! Irrlicht comes with its own scene format that I use.
2014-11-28 18:20:38	paultech	Neat!
2014-11-28 18:22:49	ralian	My project, in some respects, required actually no game development. The goal was only to get to the point where players could write mods and play around with them. It was kind of a mess, but I like the idea of having a completely configurable game.
2014-11-28 18:24:39	paultech	Yep! The scenes are mostly used for saving/reloading (Obviously there is a binary format but im not leet enough to edit in binary yet)
2014-11-28 18:24:53	paultech	Also used for networking
2014-11-28 18:25:00	paultech	for the first load of the scene

2014-11-28 18:25:23	ralian	yeah
2014-11-28 18:25:24	ralian	Irrlicht has some plugins for networking
2014-11-28 18:25:46	paultech	I'm a network admin by trade so game networking is actually the area I have some experience in!
2014-11-28 18:26:10	ralian	Lol, I don't have a trade.
2014-11-28 18:26:40	paultech	Most likely age difference there!
2014-11-28 18:26:58	ralian	I defined an asset format for my game, which was basically a tar archive with scripts, shaders, models, etc
2014-11-28 18:27:16	paultech	Good thing to have and not a bad way to do it!
2014-11-28 18:27:18	ralian	And yes, my guess is there is an age difference x)
2014-11-28 18:27:25	paultech	Tar is great if you dont need any compression and just a archive
2014-11-28 18:27:34	ralian	Yeah
2014-11-28 18:27:52	ralian	And either age difference, or you are a very young network admin
2014-11-28 18:28:22	paultech	nothing wrong with that ralian, I feel no need to judge based on age but how people conduct themselves
2014-11-28 18:28:30	paultech	haha I did get started at 17!
2014-11-28 18:28:51	paultech	How you learn about Trillek? 0x10c?
2014-11-28 18:29:03	paultech	Oh Meisaka I was going to ask if you seen this
2014-11-28 18:29:04	ralian	Yeah, I started getting serious about coding when I was 15, a year ago
2014-11-28 18:29:15	paultech	Meisaka: https://bitbucket.org/ruifig/g4devkit
2014-11-28 18:29:28	ralian	And yes, I was very disappointed when 0x10c was halted and eventually canceled
2014-11-28 18:29:29	paultech	ralian: Awesome time to start man! Keep at it
2014-11-28 18:29:59	ralian	Thanks, man :p
2014-11-28 18:30:06	ralian	I hope to stick around awhile
2014-11-28 18:30:27	paultech	If you ever need any help or input let me know! I can be a critical dick but normally I'm trying to be helpful!
2014-11-28 18:31:06	ralian	Haha, I've learned to take criticism. It's pretty easy to get in this realm.
2014-11-28 18:31:22	ralian	Good night, and thank you!
2014-11-28 18:31:30	paultech	Meisaka: The take away from g4dev was this simple C compiler thats simple to retarget - What you think?
2014-11-28 18:31:32	paultech	http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html
2014-11-28 18:31:40	paultech	Oh didn't know you were leaving! Cya ralian
2014-11-28 18:31:54	ralian	Well, I'm not leaving irc
2014-11-28 18:32:08	ralian	But I probably won't be at the computer until tomorrow

2014-11-29 14:58:47	paultech	ralian: not uncommon for a repo not to be in a buildable state. Especially forked ones such as catageek
2014-11-29 14:59:09	paultech	Trillek-client-core master/develop normally pass builds IIRC

2014-11-29 15:01:19	paultech	I like the custom solution this time around since you have much more complex syncing tasks (vcomputer), that wrapping around raknet may be more of a effort than its worth

2014-11-29 15:06:25	paultech	catageek: You look into enet at all? It may be a good way to get a leg up with a very liberal license.
2014-11-29 15:07:00	catageek	I will look enet, I don't know it well
2014-11-29 15:07:06	paultech	and adding a block cipher would be simple
2014-11-29 15:07:18	paultech	I think you will find it easy to use, I am so far
2014-11-29 15:07:54	paultech	There is a example of using XXTEA block cipher, while not secure it shows its simple to add ontop of enet
2014-11-29 15:08:08	paultech	Plus packet security is not a huge concern after auth
2014-11-29 15:08:44	paultech	Since we don't inherently trust the client, we don't trust its packets either so even if deciphered due to poor block cipher, should not have a big impact
2014-11-29 15:09:08	paultech	and auth should be hashed anyway
2014-11-29 15:09:14	ralian	paultech: How exactly are we authenticating the client?
2014-11-29 15:09:30	paultech	No idea, its catageek fork thats working on it. Some code is on the repo to read

2014-11-29 15:17:21	paultech	Nice! Thou Ideally a simplified struct of the data should only be passed to the system, not the entire frame IMO
2014-11-29 15:18:28	paultech	ralian: I'd advise not to ask, just throw build errors in here (ideally links to complete build errors) and one of us will help out I'm sure
2014-11-29 15:19:12	ralian	Is it common for a build to fail in /common/include/systems/async-data.hpp?
2014-11-29 15:19:23	ralian	Sorry, that took a minute to type out
2014-11-29 15:19:39	paultech	What branch/repo did you take from ?
2014-11-29 15:19:50	catageek	ralian: which os and which compiler
2014-11-29 15:19:52	catageek	?
2014-11-29 15:19:52	ralian	The core one.
2014-11-29 15:19:55	ralian	gcc
2014-11-29 15:19:59	ralian	I could try with clang
2014-11-29 15:20:01	paultech	and come on man, what part of async-data :P
2014-11-29 15:20:12	ralian	Well, let me get to that :p
2014-11-29 15:20:16	paultech	we dont mind helping but I'm not playing 20 questions, give the compiler output
2014-11-29 15:20:44	catageek	also check that you are trying to build https://github.com/trillek-team/trillek-client-core, develop branch
2014-11-29 15:20:56	catageek	this one is guaranted to build
2014-11-29 15:21:24	ralian	Yes, I have forked off the  develop branch, but let me check
2014-11-29 15:21:47	paultech	Also ralian travis is a good place to look for hints when building on linux (especially Debian based) https://github.com/trillek-team/trillek-client-core/blob/develop/.travis.yml
2014-11-29 15:22:16	danix111	we're not very good at keeping the building instructions up to date
2014-11-29 15:22:25	paultech	lol rapid dev, thats kinda how it works
2014-11-29 15:22:35	paultech	the merges into trillek-team should be good
2014-11-29 15:22:51	paultech	and other than my osx issue, it built without hassle on linux
2014-11-29 15:22:56	paultech	I think Zardoz had windows issues with it

2014-11-29 15:25:53	paultech	only partial
2014-11-29 15:25:59	paultech	I gave a link to what it supports

2014-11-29 15:26:03	ralian	Oh, is it not fully compliant?

2014-11-29 15:29:16	paultech	apt has 4.8 btw, apt-get install g++-4.8
2014-11-29 15:29:41	paultech	You do have to run gcc-select or something like it if I recall to correctly alias/symlink g++/gcc
2014-11-29 15:30:01	paultech	Of follow travis script and export CXX="g++-4.8" CC="gcc-4.8"; fi
2014-11-29 15:34:08	ralian	Yeah, no
2014-11-29 15:34:26	ralian	I'm on debian wheezy right now. They dropped support for 4.8.
2014-11-29 15:35:04	ralian	So I'm either going to have to update (which would be a pain but I'll have to eventually), chroot, or get a vm (which takes up quite a bit of space)
2014-11-29 15:35:31	paultech	or ya know.. do that big scary thing and just download and compile gcc
2014-11-29 15:35:44	ralian	2 spoopy
2014-11-29 15:35:57	paultech	Can install into /opt to stop it causing conflict
2014-11-29 15:36:00	paultech	or ? any path
2014-11-29 15:36:11	ralian	True
2014-11-29 15:36:41	ralian	I was going to try ~/bin/, would there be anything wrong with that?
2014-11-29 15:36:54	ralian	Would that break the version in /bin/?
2014-11-29 15:36:57	paultech	I'd do ~/gcc since it will make its own bin
2014-11-29 15:37:05	paultech	~/gcc/bin/gcc
2014-11-29 15:37:06	ralian	Okay
2014-11-29 15:37:07	paultech	for example
2014-11-29 15:37:23	ralian	Also, would you recommend 4.8 or 4.9?
2014-11-29 15:37:23	paultech	but normally a root path is used like in /opt or /usr/local/gcc-4.8
2014-11-29 15:37:31	paultech	I use 4.9 its stable
2014-11-29 15:37:39	ralian	Okay.
2014-11-29 15:38:08	paultech	and upgrade my man. wheezy come on!
2014-11-29 15:38:27	ralian	Yeah, I really should
2014-11-29 15:38:37	paultech	Do you have pbuilder ?

2014-11-29 15:47:01	paultech	Did the scriptEditorWin gui for script editing, can recycle it for ASM instructions highlighting and indenting
2014-11-29 15:49:37	zardoz84	the generic vbcc cpu target, is interesting. I would need to take a look to see if I can adapt if for the TR3200
2014-11-29 15:49:41	paultech	vbcc already has the DCPU backend, im sure adapting it to our stack would not be complicated

2014-11-29 16:00:13	paultech	ralian: Good random input. I'm not a big fan of turkey bacon
2014-11-29 16:00:19	paultech	always felt like it was tying to be something its not
2014-11-29 16:00:22	paultech	just say slice o turkey
2014-11-29 16:00:25	paultech	dont call it bacon
2014-11-29 16:00:27	paultech	geeez
2014-11-29 16:00:32	ralian	I've used it for too long, and I should switch
2014-11-29 16:00:40	paultech	You should, pork == win
2014-11-29 16:00:41	ralian	Yes, random input is a go

2014-11-29 16:01:44	paultech	Yep I did watch them too zardoz84
2014-11-29 16:02:04	paultech	I dont like his instruction set but I do like the IDE concept
2014-11-29 16:02:27	paultech	and IIRC he takes a few shortcuts in the OS that breaks it out of the stack
2014-11-29 16:02:44	ralian	Is that foobar2000 running in the background?
2014-11-29 16:02:51	paultech	no idea
2014-11-29 16:02:57	ralian	lel
2014-11-29 16:03:08	ralian	The icon with the alien face?
2014-11-29 16:03:22	ralian	Go look it up, it's the best named software ever.
2014-11-29 16:03:42	zardoz84	His CPU is interesting
2014-11-29 16:03:42	paultech	ah, not much interest to me
2014-11-29 16:03:45	paultech	got my spotify
2014-11-29 16:03:54	paultech	zardoz84: concur
2014-11-29 16:04:08	paultech	The speed of development is also impressive, very focused dev
2014-11-29 16:04:18	paultech	http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/2m6z3g/going_public_with_my_0x10c_inspired_game/
2014-11-29 16:04:21	zardoz84	Looks a mix of ideas from the DCPU-16, ARM and TMS9900 (TI-99/4 cpu)
2014-11-29 16:05:12	zardoz84	But I don't see were is defined the instruction format, the op codes values, etc...
2014-11-29 16:05:20	paultech	Yep a early focus on having a C Compiler I think helped his development as he co-wrote the OS/rom at the same time
2014-11-29 16:05:25	paultech	Oh he did publish it, let me find
2014-11-29 16:05:59	paultech	https://bitbucket.org/ruifig/g4devkit/wiki/Instruction_set
2014-11-29 16:06:19	paultech	Actually all of it is useful reading - https://bitbucket.org/ruifig/g4devkit/wiki/Home
2014-11-29 16:07:53	paultech	btw Impressive zardoz84. He states " in a way similar to some old architectures, as for example the Texas Instruments TMS9900" - You got that one spot on ;)
2014-11-29 16:08:53	zardoz84	The only cpu that I read about it that uses a RAM region as registers and can move these region, is the TMS
2014-11-29 16:09:07	paultech	Ahh
2014-11-29 16:09:24	zardoz84	the 6502 can use the first 255 bytes of ram as pseudo-register and as stack, but can move it
2014-11-29 16:09:41	paultech	can't* right?
2014-11-29 16:10:35	zardoz84	When the 6502 and the TMS was created, was a good idea, because RAM had the same or bigger speed that the CPUs. But later, it becamo a bad idea, as the CPU come  much more faster that the RAM
2014-11-29 16:10:57	paultech	Make sense
2014-11-29 16:11:28	paultech	Interesting concept that his CPU's are simulated on a server and talk to the game client/server
2014-11-29 16:11:41	paultech	Similar in concept to Meisaka isiCPU
2014-11-29 16:12:25	zardoz84	On theory we could do the same
2014-11-29 16:13:20	paultech	His OS does not allow loading process from disk, have to be compiled into the binary? Maybe I'm reading that wrong
2014-11-29 16:13:43	paultech	Ah "As the OS evolves, it might allow loading processes from a disk once there is enough support for that"
2014-11-29 16:14:23	Mode13h	It doesn't allow at the moment, until it has the required code in there (working filesystem and such)
2014-11-29 16:15:40	paultech	Yep reading more it seems its the OS lack of ability to load/resolve symbols. Realistic restriction
2014-11-29 16:15:43	paultech	You follow that project ?
2014-11-29 16:16:17	Mode13h	Ahh sorry. Yes. :)
2014-11-29 16:16:21	zardoz84	:)
2014-11-29 16:16:22	Mode13h	First time I'm around here
2014-11-29 16:16:57	paultech	Ah
2014-11-29 16:17:00	paultech	Welcome!
2014-11-29 16:17:21	Mode13h	Thank you. :D
2014-11-29 16:18:02	Mode13h	Yes Paul. The problem is that there is no loader code in the OS at the moment.
2014-11-29 16:18:36	paultech	Gotcha, Impressive looking project and may inspire us in our own vComputer!
2014-11-29 16:18:45	Mode13h	One of the viewers has been working on a filesystem I think.
2014-11-29 16:18:52	paultech	Especially the guys timeline of gameplay within a few weeks
2014-11-29 16:18:53	paultech	Awesome
2014-11-29 16:19:08	paultech	We are ahead on something! ;) We have floppies lol
2014-11-29 16:19:51	Mode13h	It has a disk controller too ;)
2014-11-29 16:20:29	Mode13h	the OS has a disk driver already. It's just the driver wasn't being used until that other guy started working on the FileSystem out of nowhere xD
2014-11-29 16:21:09	Mode13h	the vComputer is that Cpu names TR something?
2014-11-29 16:21:14	Mode13h	named
2014-11-29 16:22:51	Mode13h	TR3200  ?
2014-11-29 16:23:12	zardoz84	Yep
2014-11-29 16:25:36	Mode13h	Wife calling. :D
2014-11-29 16:25:41	paultech	Mode13h: Our Vcomputer is different. It supports multiple different CPU so long as they follow a certain spec
2014-11-29 16:25:52	paultech	DCPU,DCPU-16, TR3200
2014-11-29 16:26:21	paultech	I think I missed a N in one of those cpu's
2014-11-29 16:26:44	zardoz84	Omm.. This man is Scottish ! http://www.crazygaze.com/blog/resume/  I dais that Mr Scott is one of my favourite Star Trek characters ?
2014-11-29 16:26:49	zardoz84	"Hello computer !"
2014-11-29 16:27:01	paultech	I'm Scottish too ya know! :)

2014-11-29 16:31:30	paultech	and its ashame he folded to the WotC cease. I doubt they would of gone beyond that
2014-11-29 16:33:01	paultech	and wait a moment, in the US you can't restrict the publication of a Cease and Desis as its not part of the justice system
2014-11-29 16:33:11	paultech	its a civil request
2014-11-29 16:33:25	paultech	Something fishy there, curious if he verified the CnD was from WoTC
2014-11-29 16:33:32	paultech	Sounds more like someone tried to take down his site :/
2014-11-29 16:34:07	zardoz84	The problem is that (I think) the github repo lacks of the D&D 3.5 data

2014-11-29 17:57:23	paultech	zardoz84 is working on vComputer - The module that handles the CPU simulation in Trillek. However I also use vComputer in my own game that I'm working on. I'm currently working on adding the rendering of vComputer and the timing of Zardoz getting some work on his firmware is a great test that my vComputers are functional so, perfect timing

2014-11-30 13:23:00	paultech	http://i.imgur.com/UpgwWct.jpg
2014-11-30 13:32:52	clonk2u	paultech: a week?, i havent seen new code in the repo in a while?
2014-11-30 13:33:09	paultech	was just a funny joke, no context
2014-11-30 13:33:36	paultech	and clonk2u You need to follow the repo forks, They are constantly updated. Trillek-team seems to be only very stable or release commits
2014-11-30 13:33:56	clonk2u	paultech: i think i do
2014-11-30 13:35:08	paultech	catageek and adam have pretty active forks :)
2014-11-30 13:36:17	paultech	plus the vComputer repo is active also
2014-11-30 13:36:46	paultech	Also watch out for trillek-common as it gets updates separate from trillek-client-core
2014-11-30 13:37:12	paultech	Develop branch for trillek-team trillek-common only 6 days old :)
2014-11-30 13:37:16	paultech	since last commit
2014-11-30 13:37:19	paultech	pretty active!
2014-11-30 13:37:50	clonk2u	paultech: subbed to dev, thats why, 6 days ~ 1 week
2014-11-30 13:38:01	paultech	ah
2014-11-30 13:38:41	clonk2u	get an email everytime one of you coders adds something there
2014-11-30 13:40:06	paultech	Ya know ~ does not mean "estimate" or "close too" but equivalent, see it misused all over the place :)
2014-11-30 13:40:55	paultech	"x ~ y" means "x is equivalent to y". It is a weaker statement than stating that x equals y but is not used to denote close approximation
2014-11-30 13:41:15	clonk2u	paultech: it is when not used for code
2014-11-30 13:41:25	clonk2u	< le artiste
2014-11-30 13:42:25	paultech	Nope, it's a mathematical symbol. In code ~ means bitwise NOT, inverts the bits of the operand
2014-11-30 13:42:35	paultech	I know, just seem it misused by almost everyone :)
2014-11-30 13:42:58	clonk2u	paultech: its also an english notation
2014-11-30 13:44:31	clonk2u	paultech: its as close as we can get to the http://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?q=Approximate+Sign&w=100%&h=100%&c=1&pid=1.7&mkt=en-US&adlt=moderate&t=1 symboy so we use ~ instead
2014-11-30 13:44:53	paultech	The math symbol you want is actually ? not ~ . Yes informally ~ is used by in English to mean approximately but its rather confusing abuse of it
2014-11-30 13:45:44	paultech	lol "closet we can get" its part of the extended ASCII table lol
2014-11-30 13:46:30	paultech	Either way, not worthy of a debate,  Use it as you see fit. Just wanted to point it out that some people may read your intentions wrong
2014-11-30 13:46:34	clonk2u	paultech: well, 1. i have no clue how to access it 2. its not painted on my keyboard, and 3. some games do not support it

2014-12-01 14:25:08	danix111	welcome to #project-trillek
2014-12-01 14:25:12	Meisaka	typically is
2014-12-01 14:26:47	Meisaka	unless, someone wants to hear about my rant on emulating latency in the floppy drive
2014-12-01 14:27:26	H1N1theI|Cloud	Meisaka: if(!(rand() % 10)){ //not time yet }
2014-12-01 14:27:30	H1N1theI|Cloud	Is that how you do it?
2014-12-01 14:27:35	clonk2u	Meisaka: just make reading the drive in game use a ton of ram, then your will not need to emulate
2014-12-01 14:27:38	Meisaka	nope
2014-12-01 14:28:55	Meisaka	I simulate the disk rotating at 300RPM, how long it takes to first seek the head, then find the sector on the track
2014-12-01 14:29:27	H1N1theI|Cloud	Meisaka: 300? Isn't that a bit much? :PPP
2014-12-01 14:29:45	Meisaka	It was from the spec, so I used it
2014-12-01 14:30:33	clonk2u	Meisaka: 12RPM for a realistic feel please
2014-12-01 14:31:40	Meisaka	I could really do any speed, but I found that with the simulated encoding at 300 RPM for a 15 sector per track disk, the raw data rate is exactly 384kbps
2014-12-01 14:33:50	paultech	Does accurately simulating the rotation of the disk add anything useful to the game play? :/
2014-12-01 14:34:38	Meisaka	It makes designing a fast file system an actual challenge
2014-12-01 14:35:25	paultech	My opinion isn't a nice one so I'll keep shut it
2014-12-01 14:36:13	Meisaka	I was bored and was thinking: "these disk accesses are awfully fast..."
2014-12-01 14:37:04	paultech	Completely and utterly believable reasoning for simulating floppy drive rotation in a game that barely has enough content to require a redrawing each frame
2014-12-01 14:37:47	Meisaka	well, I am mostly doing vcomputer related stuff, that has little impact on the game
2014-12-01 14:38:15	paultech	I offered you cold hard cash to do vcomputer related stuff that would benefit trillek! :(
2014-12-01 14:38:22	paultech	(and me)
2014-12-01 14:40:37	Meisaka	that's not to say that I'm not doing them, I have a *ton* of projects that I work on.

2014-12-01 14:42:25	Meisaka	I've been writing my own TR3200 OS/ROM thing, and a C library of WaveAsm.
2014-12-01 14:42:36	H1N1theI|Cloud	Wait, no, it's an endless foward-only tape drive.
2014-12-01 14:42:49	paultech	"I was bored and was thinking: "these disk accesses are awfully fast?" " - Up the ADD meds if you have tons of projects to avoid taking on new tasks against futility
2014-12-01 14:42:54	clonk2u	H1N1theI|Cloud: 1 PRMi
2014-12-01 14:43:23	H1N1theI|Cloud	clonk2u: 1 Rotation per Universe.
2014-12-01 14:43:43	clonk2u	H1N1theI|Cloud: make that .1
2014-12-01 14:44:22	H1N1theI|Cloud	clonk2u: Make that x lim x -> 0
2014-12-01 14:45:03	clonk2u	Meisaka: can this be implemented by the end of the week?
2014-12-01 14:45:32	Meisaka	rotations per millenia?
2014-12-01 14:45:39	clonk2u	Meisaka: yep
2014-12-01 14:46:10	H1N1theI|Cloud	clonk2u: Even better: i rotations per universe.
2014-12-01 14:46:32	Meisaka	Not sure the date function returns valid times for that long
2014-12-01 14:46:40	clonk2u	H1N1theI|Cloud: no, because a millenia is unspecified
2014-12-01 14:47:01	H1N1theI|Cloud	clonk2u: millenia is undefinied over the set of imaginary numbers.
2014-12-01 14:47:08	H1N1theI|Cloud	:U
2014-12-01 14:47:28	paultech	Keep in mind time flows both ways in trillek, don't blow a capacitor spinning backwards
2014-12-01 14:50:55	Meisaka	and really, I made "slow floppy simulation" because I wanted to know if my OS would display the little waiting cursor correctly
2014-12-01 14:52:31	newguise1234	if for some reason you described rpm via a root of a number, then if you take the limit (i)^1/n as n->infinity, you end up with 1RPM
2014-12-01 14:53:20	newguise1234	with lesser roots being a rotation through the complex plane approaching 1 on the unit circle
2014-12-01 14:53:43	paultech	Gotcha, hows it coming along Meisaka?
2014-12-01 14:54:36	paultech	I'm going to start work on the IDE for vComputer in my game, just going to have a compile button that Systems() to waveasm using stdio/stdout
2014-12-01 14:54:53	paultech	Actually maybe I'll just make a unix socket and bind stdio in/out and put waveasm into a daemon
2014-12-01 14:55:05	paultech	but thats more complicated for others to run
2014-12-01 14:55:06	paultech	hm
2014-12-01 14:55:37	Meisaka	fairly good, although I may have to finish the C version of WaveAsm sooner, since it takes a while to reassemble it

2014-12-01 14:58:08	Meisaka	my collection of functions does basic input/output/line editing, a memory check, hardware scan/init, and now disk read/boot checking
2014-12-01 15:02:30	paultech	Cool, since you only really modifying internal perl structures. It compiles under B::C just fine that'll work till I get a port!
2014-12-01 15:03:16	Meisaka	I am making the C version a library
2014-12-01 15:04:04	paultech	ya this is hacky code it generates but simple enough to work and avoid the issue of including waveasm.pl

2014-12-02 05:58:50	Mode13h	Reminds me of my old zx spectrum 128k ! Good memories. Although I didn't even have a floppy! Was audio tapes
2014-12-02 06:01:23	zardoz84	I had a +3
2014-12-02 06:01:58	zardoz84	So nearly all what I did on it was with these Amstrad's 3" floppys
2014-12-02 06:02:02	zardoz84	good old times
2014-12-02 06:02:07	Mode13h	I think mine was the 2A+ or something. The Grey one. I think the +3 was black?

2014-12-02 06:02:45	Mode13h	Compared to the shitty 48k my neighbour had (with the rubbery keyboard), mine was awesome
2014-12-02 06:03:03	Mode13h	You still have it? haha
2014-12-02 06:03:05	zardoz84	Yeah! It had a "true" keyboard

2014-12-04 10:05:04	danix111	14:31:34 < ChrisSmol> someone needs to make a star trek parody, where the enterprise is plagued by as many problems as NASA
2014-12-04 10:05:10	zardoz84	xD
2014-12-04 10:05:12	Mode13h	stuff they are tested to prepare for missions to Mars in the future :D
2014-12-04 10:05:20	Mode13h	*testing
2014-12-04 10:05:25	zardoz84	NASA should buy the plans of the Buran
2014-12-04 10:05:36	zardoz84	Buran + Enerrgy
2014-12-04 10:05:39	paultech	lol
2014-12-04 10:06:00	zardoz84	It could fly alone and take earth without issues ! 101% Soviet tech
2014-12-04 10:06:02	Mode13h	Hopefully they will manage to launch tomorrow
2014-12-04 10:07:38	paultech	zardoz84: Delta-IV was flying today for nasa on ETF-1 test mission. Hold on wind then valve for fill/dump on common core failed to fully close so they reverted to IT support and "turned it on/off" 5 times, then propulsion could not give a go for flight so scrub! But Arianespace Ariane 5 launches in 4 hours
2014-12-04 10:08:56	Mode13h	What is that one for? I've been following some things, but not in detail
2014-12-04 10:09:11	paultech	nasa recently announced that Orion offically has manned mars missions in its future so they dont want the first flight to look bad? or bye bye funding
2014-12-04 10:09:34	paultech	Its a full test of Orion on Delta, the only time it  will fly on a Delta. Normally its meant for SLS
2014-12-04 10:09:57	Mode13h	yeah. I know that. That last one you mentioned, in 4 hours. Still related to the Orion?
2014-12-04 10:10:08	Mode13h	damn! browser not scrolling when you post
2014-12-04 10:10:19	paultech	Ohh, Thats Europe - nothing Orion related on that. Sat launch
2014-12-04 10:11:32	paultech	But ETF-1 is a cool flight if it launches. Orion will go high apogee on second orbit and preforms high-energy re-entry to test the test shield for moon-earth return re-entry
2014-12-04 10:11:38	paultech	er heat shield obviously
2014-12-04 10:11:57	zardoz84	So, NASA would try to come back to the Moon ?
2014-12-04 10:12:01	paultech	20k mph re-entry, we haven't done one of those since the 60's!
2014-12-04 10:12:36	paultech	Yes, Thats the plan for SLS and Orion Capture asteroid, bring it to the moon orbit and establish a small colony, then onto mars

2014-12-04 12:33:30	zardoz84	DCPU-16N implementation and specs is mainly Meisaka's work
2014-12-04 12:33:50	zardoz84	On any case, the drop of it, was a consecuence of Shane paranoia

2014-12-04 12:34:54	Meisaka	at some point (much later) I may bring it back as a mod to show how other CPUs could be added

2014-12-05 13:36:09	scybot	paultech: Bellevue, WA: Rain, 47.5F/8.6C(H:50F/10C L:45F/7C), Humidity: 99%, Wind: 3.0mph/4.8kph
2014-12-05 13:57:55	zardoz84	Aha ! I have the code monitor doing something usefull
2014-12-05 13:58:20	zardoz84	At least I can see now that the code (or floppy implementation) to load floppies is broken
2014-12-05 13:58:59	zardoz84	In other words ... self debuging a program INSIDE OF THE TRILLEK COMPUTER !
2014-12-05 14:10:01	Meisaka	I hope you are using something other than the test floppy image in repo.
2014-12-05 14:12:31	zardoz84	The firmware that I write, on theory should read sector 0 from the floppy
2014-12-05 14:12:47	zardoz84	And I don't see that is reading it
2014-12-05 14:13:05	zardoz84	I'm uploading a little video
2014-12-05 14:13:30	Meisaka	my rom can load the first sector, so I know the floppy works
2014-12-05 14:13:33	zardoz84	Not does nothing interesting, apart of printing some  variables of the firmware stored on RAM
2014-12-05 14:13:44	zardoz84	Ok, so is the firmware

2014-12-05 15:45:19	croxis	paultech: thats your game?
2014-12-05 15:50:05	paultech	It is croxis
2014-12-05 15:50:14	croxis	it looks quite nice already
2014-12-05 15:50:45	croxis	light fixture textures could use a bit more resolution though :P
2014-12-05 15:51:42	paultech	Thank you! Oh ya, its all dev quality work, The walls UV are all wrong as well, not meant to be clamped like that!
2014-12-05 15:53:02	paultech	Need to get the connections/wire drawing. Was debating using bullet soft bodies physics but think I'm just gonna draw a mesh that has 'weld' points. So you can run a wire a long distance by anchoring to walls/floors
2014-12-05 15:56:36	adam4813	zardoz84: much music such loud
2014-12-05 15:56:55	zardoz84	:D
