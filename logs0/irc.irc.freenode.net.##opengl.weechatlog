2014-11-30 04:37:58	iamtakingiteasy	hello, i have a First-Point cameras/objects (each object may be a camera via getting it's View matrix) and i am operating in Z-up, Y-depth space (imagine it like a plane which is perpendicular to display surface), but i am not sure if i am transisting from Y-up to Z-up space efficently. here is (somewhat pseudo-) code: http://paste.eientei.org/show/434/ with comments. This approach seems to be
2014-11-30 04:38:04	iamtakingiteasy	working correctly, but i am not sure if i am doing everything right and efficent. any comments would be awesome.
2014-11-30 04:39:23	iamtakingiteasy	don't mind lack of caching (like, Quaternion rotational matrix calculation results between change of rotation angles), i removed it for the sake of simplicity

2014-11-30 07:11:19	roxlu	Hi guys, I?m wondering if someone knows this: I want to get a perspective projection matrix that I can use to draw like 2D planes in such a way that e.g. x/y  of 100,100 also results in a x/y position of 100,100 in my viewport. My projection matrix math is a bit rusty but I think I need to find a plane for Z which has the same area as my viewport. But it would be perfect if I could create a projection matrix where Z=0 has this area

2014-11-30 07:17:10	Khlorghaal	oh 2d planes in perspective
2014-11-30 07:17:50	Khlorghaal	er wait, im not sure what youre asking, youre drawing rectangles in 2d?
2014-11-30 07:18:06	roxlu	hehe
2014-11-30 07:18:20	japro	roxlu, in he viewport that is odd since it it doesn't have the origin in it's center
2014-11-30 07:18:35	roxlu	yes. so basically I can draw something at the correct viewport positions easily with a ortho graphic projection
2014-11-30 07:18:54	japro	so if you want a coord->px mapping you'd either have an off center view position or a skewed frustum
2014-11-30 07:19:07	roxlu	but I want to use a perspective projection to the same, but also have a feature to ?scale? the size of the rects when I change the Z
2014-11-30 07:19:34	-->	slidercrank (~slidercra@unaffiliated/slidercrank) has joined ##OpenGL
2014-11-30 07:19:52	japro	anyway something like Frustum(-w/2, w/2, -h/2, h/2, near, far)*translate(-w/2,- h/2, -near) or so?
2014-11-30 07:20:05	japro	essentially you give the Frustum call usually the dimension of the near plane
2014-11-30 07:20:17	japro	so just set that tho your window size and offset the frustum accordingly
2014-11-30 07:25:37	roxlu	japro:  thanks, but what do you mean with ?offset the frustum? ?
2014-11-30 07:27:17	japro	well, if you just create a standard frustum the view plane will have coords from -w/2 to +w/2 etc.
2014-11-30 07:27:30	japro	while the window coords are going from 0-w or so
2014-11-30 07:27:51	japro	so you have to shift the camera over so they match
2014-11-30 07:28:30	japro	the alternative being the skewed frustm but i'm pretty sure that is not what you want
2014-11-30 07:29:32	roxlu	No indeed. I actually want a perspective projection where I don?t even need to shift the camera at all; so e.g. everything which is drawn with z=0 will be in the plane where the x/y of the plane correspond the x/y of the viewport
2014-11-30 07:30:05	japro	i mean a sideways shift
2014-11-30 07:30:26	japro	otherwise it's like you are looking at the upper right quadrant of a regular frustum
2014-11-30 07:30:31	roxlu	ah I see what you mean
2014-11-30 07:30:47	japro	meaning if you push a triangle back in the middel of the screen it will not only scale it will also wander to the top right
2014-11-30 07:31:06	japro	to the bottom lefti mean

2014-11-30 11:23:24	faenil	in the first case (per-vertex attributes: 12bytes position (floats), 4bytes color (3 ubytes+1byte padding), 4bytes UV coords (2 ushorts) )

2014-11-30 11:43:11	the_grid	urraka: maybe because the buffer is bound and then bufferData is called
2014-11-30 11:43:27	faenil	(I guess you're referring to the 1000 or 1024 base, for which I use MiB and MB though)
2014-11-30 11:43:30	urraka	the_grid you have to use glGetAttribLocation
2014-11-30 11:44:07	urraka	your program.vertexPosAttrib might be undefined and falling back to 0, making it work by chance
2014-11-30 11:44:22	Bloodust	Im referring to bytes versus bits
2014-11-30 11:45:12	faenil	bytes, isn't bits only used for networking :)
2014-11-30 11:45:34	urraka	the_grid also, you have 2 different names for the same thing program.vertexPosArray and program.vertexPosAttrib

2014-11-30 11:47:28	faenil	"Application is bound by draw operations, but the GPU is not fully utilized." it says, in the slower case

2014-11-30 11:51:11	faenil	yes but it's not affecting the perf, I modified it to use dummy functions and perf didn't change

2014-11-30 11:53:47	faenil	it's 5 glDrawArrays
2014-11-30 11:54:00	faenil	in the first case, they all take the same amount of time (about 4ms each)
2014-11-30 11:54:26	faenil	in the second case it takes 20, 13, 8, 8, 8

2014-11-30 11:58:08	faenil	I was wondering if it could just be because the color attribute alone is not 32bits aligned

2014-11-30 13:41:02	faenil	it's also interesting to note that there are 2 cases: if you don't align the vertex structure, you get 6fps instead of 40

2014-11-30 13:43:27	faenil	it seems it's not, every attribute has to be 32bits aligned
2014-11-30 13:44:03	faenil	Stragus: maybe because positions were short and color was ushort?
2014-11-30 13:44:31	Stragus	derhass, that attribute was 16 bytes at offset 6, packed after 3 attributes of 2 bytes. Clever drivers should have been able to figure this out

2014-11-30 14:05:58	ayylmaao	is there something I can read on rendering equations, using shaders?

2014-11-30 14:07:42	rleigh_	I guess you could also take a hybrid approach and use a coarse n-gon for the interior and a fragment shader for the border area region to do a nice smooth edge?
2014-11-30 14:08:18	Stragus	Bottom line, ayylmaao, there are many ways to proceed. What do you need a circle for?
2014-11-30 14:08:46	ayylmaao	I think I'll go with the n-gons for now, but I'd definitely like to look into the fragment-shader option, as an improvement
2014-11-30 14:09:01	ayylmaao	Stragus: I want to just render circles in 3-space
2014-11-30 14:09:19	derhass	rleigh_: yeah
2014-11-30 14:09:21	Stragus	Textured quads (two triangles) would seem like an easier option
2014-11-30 14:09:29	derhass	rleigh_: i actually would suggest that for unfilled circles
2014-11-30 14:10:02	derhass	just with a tessalated border
2014-11-30 14:10:13	rleigh_	Hmm, or maybe just use varying vertex colour between centre and edge and threshold it to avoid any additional geometry calculations?
2014-11-30 14:11:23	rleigh_	No, that wouldn't be sufficient on its own would it.
2014-11-30 14:11:52	ayylmaao	in order to render the equations in a shader, I'd basically need to implement a simple ray-tracer that get's feed the parameters of my equations, right?
2014-11-30 14:12:14	Stragus	What? It's a circle, distance to center, no ray-tracing involved
2014-11-30 14:12:48	ayylmaao	I don't understand
2014-11-30 14:12:49	Stragus	You would render a quad (two triangles) in 3D space, and for each visible fragment, compute if the fragment's distance is within the circle or not
2014-11-30 14:13:53	Madsy	Turning on MSAA and rendering points should give you circles as well, but I don't know if the spec guarantees that
2014-11-30 14:15:10	ayylmaao	Stragus: I still don't understand :-(
2014-11-30 14:15:38	ayylmaao	you're saying that I should draw a quad that fills my screen, and on which the shader gets run?

2014-11-30 14:15:50	Stragus	A fragment shader is a little piece of code that lets you perform any computation you want for each fragment, to decide what you want to do with your pixel
2014-11-30 14:16:10	ayylmaao	a fragment is a pixel, right?
2014-11-30 14:16:11	Stragus	So you could, for each fragment, compute the fragment's distance to the circle's center and decide if it's "in" or "out"
2014-11-30 14:16:13	Madsy	ayylmaao: You draw a quad and plot the color and alpha based on a distance function. The distance from the center with relation to the radius

2014-11-30 14:19:31	ayylmaao	Madsy: if I have more than one circle, I mean
2014-11-30 14:20:06	Madsy	ayylmaao: Why would that be a problem? If you have more circles, you render more circles.
2014-11-30 14:20:25	Madsy	More circles = more quads
2014-11-30 14:20:44	ayylmaao	ok. I thought I'd need one quad for the entire screen
2014-11-30 14:21:23	ayylmaao	so the quads have the circles inscribed?

2014-11-30 14:22:51	rleigh_	ayylmaao: If you passed in the centre point and radius as uniforms, you can calculate the distance between the point being rendered and the circle centre and choose to colour it or not if the distance is < the radius.
2014-11-30 14:23:41	Stragus	ayylmaao, it's like textured quads floating in 3D space, except that you use a fragment shader instead of a texture to draw your circle
2014-11-30 14:23:58	ayylmaao	ok. I get it now
2014-11-30 14:24:49	ayylmaao	thx :-)

2014-11-30 18:04:38	foobaz	i like go :)
2014-11-30 18:04:53	derhass	i though the point of this code would be that it works for arbitrary directions
2014-11-30 18:05:00	axion	that works?
2014-11-30 18:05:08	foobaz	click "run"
2014-11-30 18:05:23	foobaz	doesn't my code work for arbitrary directions?
2014-11-30 18:05:26	derhass	it just maps those 6 inputs to those 6 outputs
2014-11-30 18:05:47	foobaz	no, it does the math
2014-11-30 18:06:02	foobaz	my algorithm is in new()
2014-11-30 18:06:12	foobaz	as compared to his original broken algorithm in old()
2014-11-30 18:06:36	derhass	ah, ok
2014-11-30 18:07:34	axion	hmm trying to make sense of the code
2014-11-30 18:07:40	foobaz	i use -y, as i said earlier, and i add 0.5 to shift it from -0.5..0.5 to 0..1, whicih is like i said but it's easier to do the shift after dividing by 2*pi
2014-11-30 18:07:59	foobaz	and the last +0.5 is to shift it up so the floor rounds to nearest instead of rounding down
2014-11-30 18:08:51	foobaz	that is necessary because with six directions, list offsets are 60 degrees apart, but you are passing in values like <-1, 1>, which is at 45 degrees
2014-11-30 18:09:12	axion	doh i didnt see the new function...had to scroll
2014-11-30 18:09:17	axion	now its clear
2014-11-30 18:09:53	derhass	yeah, and I'm an idiot. atan2(1,1) should be pi/4 of course
2014-11-30 18:09:55	foobaz	it might be nicer to multiply x or y to transform the coordinate system so that NE, SW, et al get moved to 60 degrees instead of 45
2014-11-30 18:10:22	foobaz	that might be necessary for longer distances
2014-11-30 18:10:25	axion	let me try...thanks :)
2014-11-30 18:10:31	axion	this is only for computing adjacent neighbors
2014-11-30 18:10:54	foobaz	you should use round() instead of floor(+0.5)
2014-11-30 18:11:05	foobaz	but unfortunately go does not have round so i had to use floor

2014-11-30 23:17:45	slime	in shader code you can sample from textures using the texture() function and a sampler uniform, you set the sampler uniform variable to point to a texture unit index (via glUniform1i with the shader program active), and then when you bind a texture of the same type as your sampler to that texture unit (via glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + index); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_whatevertype, textureID)) and use glDraw*, the shader will sample from that
2014-11-30 23:17:45	slime	texture using the texture(mysampler, texcoord) function
2014-11-30 23:19:11	slime	of course you have to create the texture and tell OpenGL to allocate data for it before all that, using glGenTextures+glBindTexture and glTexImage2D/3D or glTexStorage2D/3D

2014-11-30 23:21:37	adamvan101	So I must first activate a GL_TEXTURE0, then I can bind my textures[0] data to that GL variable, so that I can just activate that in the future?
2014-11-30 23:21:43	slime	your textures[0] is a texture ID, which you'd bind to a texture unit by using glBindTexture after glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + texunitindex)
2014-11-30 23:22:09	adamvan101	And the active texture unit always gets passed to the sampler?
2014-11-30 23:22:50	adamvan101	Do I call glUniform1i() on the texture unit, or the texture ID?
2014-11-30 23:22:59	slime	you select a texture unit index for a uniform sampler to sample from with glUniform1i(glGetUniformLocation("mysampler"), texunitindex)
2014-11-30 23:23:53	adamvan101	is GL_TEXTURE0 for a CUBE_MAP texture type replaceable by a TEXTURE_2D type?
2014-11-30 23:24:23	slime	you'll need to change your sampler type in your shader
2014-11-30 23:24:46	slime	from samplerCube to sampler2D
2014-11-30 23:26:03	adamvan101	Ok -- so if I activate GL_TEXTURE0, then bind an ID (for CUBE_MAP) to it, I'll probably want to activate GL_TEXTURE0 + 1 to bind a different ID for a 2D_TEXTURE?

2014-12-01 01:42:25	glYoda	one which isn't terribly meaningful to begin with
2014-12-01 01:42:32	neure	and the factors are not the stuff that fragment shader outputs

2014-12-01 01:44:10	neure	not much options in ES 2
2014-12-01 01:44:15	glYoda	if they aren't able to clamp explicitly during render

2014-12-01 01:44:57	glYoda	neure umm no? ES 2.x supports non UNORM formats for render and for texture via extension
2014-12-01 01:45:03	glYoda	so I'd consider that a moot point
2014-12-01 01:45:15	glYoda	yes it isn't in core but it IS quite widely supported

2014-12-01 01:45:41	glYoda	today doesn't change that much AFAIC
2014-12-01 01:45:43	neure	that was a while back
2014-12-01 01:46:00	glYoda	as was I? and I did it through extensions

2014-12-01 02:20:16	neure	OpenGL expects images to be bottom up, mathematical coordinates
2014-12-01 02:20:31	adamvan101	So if anythign it might be upsidedown?

2014-12-01 02:21:12	neure	well, i think it is likely it would show up upside down, i never used ppm format
2014-12-01 02:21:33	neure	also you can deal with it in many ways, including by setting your texture coordinates to take this into account
2014-12-01 02:21:40	Stragus	It would seem wise to use a different image format too

2014-12-01 02:41:55	Bloodust	actually IIRC freeimage does not depend on those

2014-12-01 02:47:58	Stragus	Are your lines of pixel multiple of 4 bytes?
2014-12-01 02:48:18	Stragus	Try   glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1 );
2014-12-01 02:48:50	adamvan101	anywhere, like in an init method?
2014-12-01 02:49:06	Stragus	Anywhere, before uploading your texture
2014-12-01 02:49:39	Stragus	That's probably not it unless your texture has some weird dimensions
2014-12-01 02:49:40	adamvan101	Doesn't help... But it does look lines of rgb
2014-12-01 02:49:47	adamvan101	640x640...? Not powers of 2
2014-12-01 02:51:36	adamvan101	a 512x512 isnt' any better
2014-12-01 02:52:05	Stragus	Right, the unpack alignment is only an issue for widths which aren't 4 bytes aligned (by default)
2014-12-01 02:52:25	Stragus	Can't help with stb_image though

2014-12-01 03:02:12	adamvan101	It's not to do with the texturing. There are lots of tiled squares, and I would have expected the shading to transition over them as a whole, instead of tiling as well

2014-12-01 03:14:59	serengeor	Hello, I have quite a big performance problem during loading time. I'm doing voxel based world and using vectors to store vertices, indices.
2014-12-01 03:15:42	serengeor	When I generate the mesh i have lots of realocations due to vector size increase
2014-12-01 03:16:48	serengeor	I was wondering if there's any way I could reduce reallocations to the minimum? (not really an opengl problem, but hopefully someone has encountered this and "solved it")
2014-12-01 03:17:04	Stragus	Preallocate the memory you expect to use, or use linked lists of big fixed buffers and repack at the end
2014-12-01 03:18:10	serengeor	Stragus, expectating something is not that easy, cause I'm optimizing the face count for each area
2014-12-01 03:18:50	Stragus	Then use a linked list of big buffers. When you are done, allocate your OpenGL buffers to the right size and upload each buffer to the right offset
2014-12-01 03:18:51	Bloodust	preallocation is the obvious answer
2014-12-01 03:18:51	serengeor	I thought about using some more dynamic structure, but I haven't tried it yet
2014-12-01 03:19:31	Bloodust	dont you have a rough estime on how much memory do you use?
2014-12-01 03:20:23	serengeor	Bloodust, not really, I'm doing face merging and culling, so it's a bit tricky to know ahead of time how many face's will there be in a buffer
2014-12-01 03:21:02	serengeor	I guess allocating bigger buffers and packing more than one area would be better :?
2014-12-01 03:21:19	Bloodust	Id just start with 1GB buffer and see where it goes

2014-12-01 20:52:51	foobaz	why not use glew?
2014-12-01 20:53:09	Khlorghaal	do the legacy texture things like texture matrix affect glsl samplers? im having this really weird problem that i think can only be explained by that
2014-12-01 20:53:19	foobaz	i?m not familiar with GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES but it seems like glew would be more reliable, as it handles various edge cases

2014-12-01 20:58:08	AgentElrond	It would be a case where I will require a minimum GL version anyway, since shader support on some basic level would be required.
2014-12-01 20:58:19	AgentElrond	So basic glGenBuffers or whatever.  If a user doesn't have that, they can't run it anyway.

2014-12-01 22:29:27	slime	delicado: KTX (and DDS) are just container file formats for a number of different texture formats
2014-12-01 22:29:37	Polarina	delicado, it supports every texture format supported by OpenGL. It stores the GLenum directly along with the texture data.

2014-12-01 22:35:16	hackish	I need advice on a 3d library. Need something that will do C++, is not GNU although LGPL works, can do text and 3d surface plots and finally is portable between windows and mac. Not complicated 3d stuff, just need it to work without expending a month of programming time. I've been looking at coin3d and sgi open inventor. Any opinions?

2014-12-01 22:51:58	chrisf	hackish: sounds like what you want is actually something like gnuplot
2014-12-01 22:52:10	hackish	don't need sound, physics, lighting effects (like fog and all that).
2014-12-01 22:52:41	hackish	yes very much like gnuplot
2014-12-01 22:52:51	hackish	it's a commercial application so it can't be GNU polluted.
2014-12-01 22:54:33	chrisf	hackish: it's not GPL, it's got a weird custom license.
2014-12-01 22:55:06	hackish	hrmmm. that could be an option. I did ASSume that it was open sores licensed.
2014-12-01 22:56:56	dca	why would textureLod(..., level) give same results for each level?
2014-12-01 22:57:42	hackish	yeah that is a weird license.
2014-12-01 23:01:16	Khlorghaal	dca: because each level is the same? lol

2014-12-01 23:03:42	hackish	Although gnuplot is similar to what I need it is lacking in any sort of interactivity like rotating the surfaces and modifying the data in realtime.
2014-12-01 23:04:08	Khlorghaal	dca: is there more than one level? it might be clamping everything to level 0
2014-12-01 23:04:08	Polarina	hackish, last I used gnuplot it could rotate the surface just fine.
2014-12-01 23:04:58	hackish	ok maybe I should dig into it deeper then. What I saw just looked like a command line utility for making jpeg files from graph data.
2014-12-01 23:05:23	Polarina	hackish, gnuplot can do a lot more than just that.

2014-12-01 23:07:55	Khlorghaal	its default 1000 though, so unless you changed it
2014-12-01 23:08:05	dca	yeah i didn't
2014-12-01 23:08:46	dca	some old posts say textureLod is only for vertex shaders

2014-12-01 23:41:45	Stragus	There's nothing magic about texturing triangle strips, the vertices are reused including the texcoords associated with them
2014-12-01 23:42:45	axion	how do you know what to use for texture coordinates for say a hexagon drawn with triangle strips?
2014-12-01 23:45:49	Stragus	It's no different from using regular triangles and reusing vertices, glDrawElements()
2014-12-01 23:46:43	axion	hmm my texture seems stretched on strips compared to fans
2014-12-01 23:46:58	axion	i'm not versed in raw opengl methods
2014-12-01 23:47:03	Stragus	There's probably something wrong with the texture coordinates
2014-12-01 23:47:12	axion	definitely
2014-12-01 23:47:27	Stragus	For a regular hex with an uniformly spaced texture, texcoords should be directly related to vertex positions (with some scale)

2014-12-02 13:50:56	JoshSyn	so is it okay if I destroy the shader program after binding to VAOs?
2014-12-02 13:51:17	JoshSyn	it should create a copy isn't it?
2014-12-02 13:51:55	Bloodust	what no :D
2014-12-02 13:51:58	Bloodust	dont destroy it :D
2014-12-02 13:52:04	Bloodust	VAO doesnt store shader programs :D
2014-12-02 13:52:54	Bloodust	rendering goes something like this: { shader.bind(); vao.bind(); draw(); vao2.bind(); draw2(); vao3.bind(); draw3(); ... }
2014-12-02 13:53:46	JoshSyn	why is VAO such a silly name
2014-12-02 13:53:54	JoshSyn	it is so confusing

2014-12-02 18:43:57	Stragus	I think glBegin is misleading about how code and data should be designed
2014-12-02 18:44:10	Stragus	Better go for vertex arrays directly, before progressing to Vertex Buffer Objects
2014-12-02 18:44:20	dahlia	my biggest complaint about OpenTK was some of the math funtions were poorly written and slow
2014-12-02 18:44:28	derhass	ali1234: actually, vertex arrays show how immediate mode works internally
2014-12-02 18:44:43	slime	^^
2014-12-02 18:44:54	Erisat	lots of interesting info guys, thanks :D
2014-12-02 18:44:56	ali1234	implementation yes, theory no
2014-12-02 18:45:00	Erisat	ima check out those links
2014-12-02 18:45:37	ali1234	i'm not advocating that you write more than one simple program with immediate mode or anything
2014-12-02 18:45:38	derhass	ali1234: I still disagree
2014-12-02 18:45:44	ali1234	i just think you should start at the start
2014-12-02 18:45:53	roboman2444	immediate mode is fine for very simple things
2014-12-02 18:45:59	roboman2444	like glxgears
2014-12-02 18:46:12	derhass	glxgears uses display lists
2014-12-02 18:46:21	foobaz	i wish there were a high level opengl API that beginners could start with to ease them into it
2014-12-02 18:46:29	Erisat	^
2014-12-02 18:46:31	foobaz	but unfortunately, immediate mode is not that API
2014-12-02 18:46:39	danhedron	if your area of expertise is "the history of opengl" then immediate mode is a fine place to start
2014-12-02 18:46:42	dahlia	display lists can be pretty fast
2014-12-02 18:46:42	danhedron	otherwise.. no
2014-12-02 18:46:45	Codex_	display lists are alot faster than immediate mode
2014-12-02 18:47:03	foobaz	anything is a lot faster than immediate mode :)
2014-12-02 18:47:42	dahlia	Anyway I thought OpenTK was pretty well done for the most part
2014-12-02 18:48:09	Erisat	it seems like the simplest toolkit ive found to get started with
2014-12-02 18:48:20	Erisat	after quite a bit of googling lol
2014-12-02 18:48:46	dahlia	ya it's pretty thin too so doesn't get in the way performance wise
2014-12-02 18:49:11	Erisat	and i love how its in C#. I'm unfamiliar with c++ so alot of other tools out there would make me not only need to learn opengl, but learn a new language as well
2014-12-02 18:49:27	Erisat	too much at once
2014-12-02 18:49:44	foobaz	C# is a nice language
2014-12-02 18:49:48	dahlia	I really like c# a lot. I just am not a big fan of Mono :/
2014-12-02 18:52:01	Stragus	I can't handle a language that doesn't get directly compiled to machine code, with control over it
2014-12-02 18:52:09	Stragus	I need my SSE and AVX intrinsics, among other things

2014-12-03 10:06:34	AbigailBuccaneer	dostoyevsky, to answer your first question, yes, ##OpenGL is appropriate for OpenGL ES as well
2014-12-03 10:07:57	AbigailBuccaneer	passing data from a shader to the CPU requires rendering with that shader to a texture, and then downloading that texture to the CPU (which I think in GLES requires glReadPixels)
2014-12-03 10:08:15	AbigailBuccaneer	however, fragment shaders aren't a great fit for the process you just described

2014-12-03 10:10:58	AbigailBuccaneer	dostoyevsky, OpenCV < http://opencv.org/ >, a popular image processing and computer vision library, uses OpenCL
2014-12-03 10:12:06	AbigailBuccaneer	dostoyevsky, fragment shaders are typically not nearly flexible enough for what you want, because they're only as parallel as the amount of data (ie. number of fragments) they're outputting. if you just want to find the coordinates of the darkest region, a fragment shader is really quite inappropriate for that

2014-12-03 11:03:49	AbigailBuccaneer	it entirely depends on what type of application you're creating, what you want to do, what range of hardware you're likely to run on, etc.
2014-12-03 11:04:02	AbigailBuccaneer	ESphynx, and it's presumably an OpenGL app?
2014-12-03 11:04:05	ESphynx	well I also want to avoid some 'hic' ups on desktop
2014-12-03 11:04:16	ESphynx	yes OpenGL app :P
2014-12-03 11:04:30	AbigailBuccaneer	by "responsiveness" and "'hic' ups" do you mean "framerate" and "framerate hitches"?
2014-12-03 11:04:30	ESphynx	I'd like to avoid the UI lock ups

2014-12-03 11:05:14	ESphynx	but I was just reading this post there saying that it's better to decode stuff, and pass it to the main thread doing the rendering for it to upload to the GPU
2014-12-03 11:05:18	ESphynx	is that sometimes true?
2014-12-03 11:05:21	AbigailBuccaneer	and presumably "stuff" is resources used by OpenGL (eg. texture and model data)?

2014-12-03 11:05:41	asagk1963	perhaps get resources loaded in a seperate thread. that already solves such sort of hic ups in most cases
2014-12-03 11:06:07	ESphynx	asagk1963: right that's what I'm wondering if I should do that... that is, even galling glBufferData / glTexImage2D from that other thread?
2014-12-03 11:06:36	AbigailBuccaneer	ESphynx, multithreading with OpenGL is non-trivial

2014-12-03 11:07:41	AbigailBuccaneer	the path of least resistance is probably to load everything on threads but then to upload to the GPU (ie. glBufferData/glTexImage2D) only on the main thread

2014-12-03 11:09:05	asagk1963	when you have some "ingame environment" you might also be able to tell ahead what kind of resources (text/modell/sounds) you might want to see in the near future. get those loaded ahead in some else thread. that mostly works fine
2014-12-03 11:09:09	ESphynx	On Windows I did notice a better performance while rendering in the main UI thread
2014-12-03 11:09:21	ESphynx	but on Android/NDK wondering whether one is expected to render in a separate thread?
2014-12-03 11:09:32	asagk1963	but perhaps do not intermix graphics processing in more than one thread at a time

2014-12-03 11:10:37	AbigailBuccaneer	ESphynx, glBufferData will stall. but once your data's already loaded from disk, glBufferData isn't particularly slow
2014-12-03 11:11:09	AbigailBuccaneer	depending on what version of OpenGL ES you're targeting, you could map a buffer and write into it from a secondary thread
2014-12-03 11:11:09	ESphynx	AbigailBuccaneer: It will stall no matter what?
2014-12-03 11:11:48	ESphynx	AbigailBuccaneer: APIs , versions for that?
2014-12-03 11:11:49	AbigailBuccaneer	ESphynx, yes - as soon as the call to glBufferData finishes you're able to delete that memory no matter what, so it's inherently a blocking operation

2014-12-03 11:17:18	ESphynx	jophish: well I've got 2 issues... major hicups while stuff is loading (brieg jams on the desktop, reponsiveness issue on Android)  and app getting on android because memory is peaking too high I think
2014-12-03 11:17:34	ESphynx	getting killed*
2014-12-03 11:17:53	jophish	show a loading screen while things are loading
2014-12-03 11:18:14	ESphynx	jophish: talking about continous loading

2014-12-03 11:18:33	jophish	Load smaller chunks more often
2014-12-03 11:18:58	jophish	work out how fast things stream ot the gpu, and limit yourself to Xms a frame of uploading and put that in the frame budget
2014-12-03 11:19:32	ESphynx	well part of the problem is not just GPU transfer, there's some CPU processing involved.
2014-12-03 11:19:50	jophish	Don't do the cpu processing on the render thread
2014-12-03 11:20:03	ESphynx	so ideally first I want to thread more of that... but I was sort of limited in that because requiring to upload to GL textures/buffers
2014-12-03 11:20:09	jophish	map the buffer, cpu process into that on another thread, unmap the buffer
2014-12-03 11:20:26	ESphynx	so hence why I'm asking... is it really better to do the uploda on the render thread
2014-12-03 11:20:30	jophish	the mapping and the unmapping happens on the render thread
2014-12-03 11:20:50	ESphynx	when you talking about mapping buffer, I get lost... are you talking about ES 3 only stuff?

2014-12-03 11:22:36	AbigailBuccaneer	buffer mapping is only in ES3, ESphynx

2014-12-03 11:23:03	jophish	that's sucks
2014-12-03 11:23:42	asagk1963	Android does not have ES3 at this time. Only ES 1.0/1.1/2.0
2014-12-03 11:23:50	AbigailBuccaneer	asagk1963, incorrect.
2014-12-03 11:24:02	ESphynx	basically I want to know whether I'm better off to set up 2 GL contexts and call glBufferData / glTexImage2D in the loading thread, or if I'm better off just loading into a RAM buffer there and synchronize loading that to the GPU in the render thread?
2014-12-03 11:24:12	asagk1963	really? I was pretty sure about this. But perhaps I am wrong?
2014-12-03 11:24:39	ESphynx	Is ES 3 new with Lollipop?

2014-12-03 11:27:37	ESphynx	isn't everyone just using BufferData and drivers optimized to do that as efficiently as possible?
2014-12-03 11:27:41	jophish	ESphynx: read this: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pcozzi/OpenGLInsights/OpenGLInsights-AsynchronousBufferTransfers.pdf
2014-12-03 11:28:16	jophish	or better yet, implement all the methods yourself and see what performs best
2014-12-03 11:28:38	AbigailBuccaneer	ESphynx, glBufferData is still synchronous, whereas glMapBufferRange lets you be as asynchronous as you want about your loading
2014-12-03 11:29:07	ESphynx	this paper has no date

2014-12-03 11:29:53	ESphynx	AbigailBuccaneer: right, but if I do delete the data right after I do want it to be synchronous... and if I render it right away it still needs to complete?
2014-12-03 11:30:37	AbigailBuccaneer	ESphynx, if you mapped the buffer you wouldn't be deleting the data as you'd typically load directly into the buffer rather than creating your own CPU-side buffer

2014-12-03 18:43:53	dahlia	Ive done that, wasnt that hard
2014-12-03 18:43:55	Domx	yeah but the use stuff like "/n/n" means end of header
2014-12-03 18:43:56	Stragus	HTML though... I wouldn't want to do that

2014-12-03 18:44:28	Domx	that's what im looking at at the moment
2014-12-03 18:44:55	Domx	can i force my server not to do chunked?
2014-12-03 18:45:00	dahlia	isnt it a double carrige return/linefeed?
2014-12-03 18:45:08	Stragus	Yes, by making a HTTP 1.0 request
2014-12-03 18:45:13	Stragus	But you then lose keep-alive and such
2014-12-03 18:45:21	Domx	im not using keep-alive

2014-12-03 22:27:03	foobaz	uniforms are only constant over the course of a draw call
2014-12-03 22:27:08	foobaz	you can change them between draw calls
2014-12-03 22:27:39	foobaz	if you can't figure out a way to do it in one draw call that you are happy with, then use multiple draw calls, it will be much simpler
2014-12-03 22:27:45	chrisf	Cooler: *simplest* thing is to split your draw
2014-12-03 22:28:02	chrisf	Cooler: you can draw different ranges from the same VBO just fine, and set uniforms in between
2014-12-03 22:28:06	Cooler	so i can't just do it in one glDrawElements?
2014-12-03 22:28:17	foobaz	you can, but it's harder
2014-12-03 22:28:27	foobaz	UBO is the standard technique
2014-12-03 22:29:05	Cooler	So i add a new vertex attribute for the rotation?
2014-12-03 22:29:30	foobaz	no, then you have to modify your VBO every time it rotates, modifying a VBO is more expensive than a draw call
2014-12-03 22:29:35	foobaz	use a uniform
2014-12-03 22:30:31	foobaz	lots of draw calls on static VBOs will be much faster than one draw call on a VBO which is changing every frame

2014-12-03 22:33:52	 *	roboman2444 dies a little inside
2014-12-03 22:34:13	foobaz	you should pass a uniform to your vertex shader to do that translation, that way you don't need to change the VBO
2014-12-03 22:34:21	foobaz	it would be so much faster that way, and easier

2014-12-03 22:35:29	roboman2444	foobaz, Cooler, if he does push all vertex data every frame, he could have this var he needs to change be a vertex attrib

2014-12-03 23:07:55	chrisf	Domx: what language are you working in?
2014-12-03 23:07:56	bob_twinkles	just use like libcurl or something though
2014-12-03 23:08:03	bob_twinkles	(assuming you're doing this in C)
2014-12-03 23:08:05	Domx	c++ for game C# .net for the server
2014-12-03 23:08:35	Domx	bob_twinkles: libcurl needs to compiled to use on iOS and it needs to transcompile with emscripten
2014-12-03 23:08:49	Domx	thus i went a sockets only approach
2014-12-03 23:09:14	dahlia	why use a http lib with emscripten? you dont even have real sockets
2014-12-03 23:09:36	Domx	it's working i just need to concatenate the response chunks

2014-12-03 23:10:41	Domx	oh thats apart of the emscripten stuff right
2014-12-03 23:11:22	dahlia	if you use emscripten, just call into javascript to do http stuff. You're stuck with the browser stack anyway
2014-12-03 23:12:06	Domx	i thought emscripten supported C socket stuff through websockets?
2014-12-03 23:12:22	dahlia	websockets dont work as normal sockets
2014-12-03 23:12:39	Domx	emscripten wont automagically do it for me?
2014-12-03 23:12:48	dahlia	it cant
2014-12-03 23:13:03	dahlia	javascript doesnt have normal sockets
2014-12-03 23:13:45	bob_twinkles	websockets have their own protocol on top of tcp
2014-12-03 23:13:53	chrisf	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455
2014-12-03 23:14:52	Domx	eh thats okay i abstracted everything out properly
2014-12-03 23:15:04	foobaz	i don't understand why they didn't just add regular sockets to javascript
2014-12-03 23:15:08	Domx	i can just wrap my socket stuff in a #ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
2014-12-03 23:15:13	chrisf	Domx: now to make this relevant to #opengl, how are you going to do it on the gpu instead?
2014-12-03 23:15:19	Domx	and add in the emscripten stuff
2014-12-03 23:15:28	foobaz	websockets have ridiculous amounts of useless overhead
2014-12-03 23:15:29	Domx	chrisf: hehe
2014-12-03 23:15:32	dahlia	if you use websockets you will need to use them on both endpoints

2014-12-04 01:32:27	Stragus	You probably don't want to install Mesa with a slow software implementation, you'll want the drivers to use the GPU

2014-12-04 05:17:39	jophish	axion: take a look at Assimp
2014-12-04 05:17:39	Bloodust	the difference is very small
2014-12-04 05:17:57	Bloodust	and parsing the .obj file is the same for both
2014-12-04 05:18:06	axion	well so far i parsed the 'v' vertexes
2014-12-04 05:18:18	axion	i'm not sure where in opengl to put the other values
2014-12-04 05:19:32	Bloodust	parse vertices, normals and texture coordinates to separate arrays
2014-12-04 05:19:34	axion	i am also not using C/++. trying to make a library for my language
2014-12-04 05:19:53	Bloodust	then parse the faces and pick the right data from the vertex/normal/texture arrays

2014-12-04 05:21:09	axion	i never used normals before
2014-12-04 05:21:17	Bloodust	you dont have to if you dont want to
2014-12-04 05:21:25	Bloodust	you just cant have lighting without normals
2014-12-04 05:21:28	axion	also how do i know which primtiive to draw them with?
2014-12-04 05:22:00	jophish	Bloodust: you could reconstruct them in a shader
2014-12-04 05:22:07	axion	because everything i've tried results in a blob of garbage triangles
2014-12-04 05:22:19	Bloodust	axion usually triangles

2014-12-04 05:22:33	Bloodust	see how your .obj exporter exports the model

2014-12-04 05:22:50	Bloodust	also, if the 'f' has 3 parts then its a triangle
2014-12-04 05:22:53	axion	my friend created a model for me, speicific with tris
2014-12-04 05:22:55	Bloodust	if 4 then its probably a quad
2014-12-04 05:22:55	axion	and it does
2014-12-04 05:23:00	axion	3
2014-12-04 05:23:16	AbigailBuccaneer	axion, are you doing indexing properly?
2014-12-04 05:23:19	Bloodust	then I suppose your obj importer / renderer fails somewhere
2014-12-04 05:23:35	axion	it's only reading "v"
2014-12-04 05:23:40	axion	do i do something with "f"?
2014-12-04 05:23:43	AbigailBuccaneer	there's your problem
2014-12-04 05:23:58	AbigailBuccaneer	the 'v' is just a list of vertices, the 'f' defines how they're assembled into triangles
2014-12-04 05:23:59	Bloodust	yes lol
2014-12-04 05:24:29	axion	ok, like i said i draw stuff all the time with just vertices. i don't know how to apply f to v in code
2014-12-04 05:25:00	AbigailBuccaneer	when you come across a 'v', don't immediately call glVertex3f or whatever
2014-12-04 05:25:04	Bloodust	with just vertices, f 1 2 3 means draw triangle using the first, the second and the third vertex
2014-12-04 05:25:10	AbigailBuccaneer	you need to add it to an array
2014-12-04 05:25:21	AbigailBuccaneer	and then the parameters of an 'f' are the indexes into that array to draw
2014-12-04 05:25:48	Bloodust	and dont use glVertex3f etc. use glDrawArrays without VBOs if you dont have support for VBOs
2014-12-04 05:25:57	Bloodust	its still immediate mode but its very future proof
2014-12-04 05:26:13	ESphynx	Erisat: trying to optimize stuff :P
2014-12-04 05:26:32	Erisat	I'm just goofing around trying to learn

2014-12-04 05:27:15	ESphynx	(with software rendering, of course :P)
2014-12-04 05:27:21	axion	Bloodust: btw, what is "vt"?
2014-12-04 05:27:25	Bloodust	texture coordinate
2014-12-04 05:27:26	axion	texture?

2014-12-04 05:37:46	Bloodust	means your .obj file is probably broken
2014-12-04 05:37:54	Bloodust	or some weird feature in .obj specification im not aware of
2014-12-04 05:38:32	Yaniel	obj has a specification?
2014-12-04 05:38:50	Bloodust	I think so

2014-12-04 05:39:08	AbigailBuccaneer	dangit
2014-12-04 05:39:13	axion	ok, and if a face line is: 1/2/3 4/5/6 7/8/9, how do i access my vertex array exactly?
2014-12-04 05:39:25	axion	i was expecting 3 values
2014-12-04 05:39:29	Bloodust	yeah
2014-12-04 05:39:44	Bloodust	the format is f v/t/n or f v/n/t
2014-12-04 05:39:55	Bloodust	so the first integer is the vertex index
2014-12-04 05:40:01	axion	ah so i only care about the first character in each set
2014-12-04 05:40:11	AbigailBuccaneer	axion, unless you want normals or texturing
2014-12-04 05:40:16	axion	not yet :)

2014-12-04 11:26:32	aethersis	there : "All the necessary core-JDK modifications have since been pushed to OpenJDK 7,[6] which means that Java can now be used on a graphics stack other than one of those provided by the official JDK (X Window System, OpenGL or DirectX), by including an external library and setting some system properties."

2014-12-04 11:43:41	ray_caster	1234567890 have extra pixels at the bottom when rendered 1:1. Other letters such as 'Q' and 'u' are off by a few pixels at all sizes
2014-12-04 11:45:10	ray_caster	For 'Q' and 'u' I believe the texture coordinates are messed up to some degree because the error repeats and isn't localized to where on the screen I am rendering
2014-12-04 11:45:39	ray_caster	Any ideas what could be wrong?
2014-12-04 11:47:15	AbigailBuccaneer	ray_caster, and these are being rendered as textured polygons?
2014-12-04 11:47:22	ray_caster	yes
2014-12-04 11:47:58	AbigailBuccaneer	well, you're never gonna get perfect rendering unless the texel-to-pixel ratio is an integer (ie. you're rendering at 1:1 or 2:1 etc.)
2014-12-04 11:48:18	ray_caster	that's what I'm doing though
2014-12-04 11:48:36	ray_caster	1:1 is the lowest ratio I'm allowing, 2:1 is the next one
2014-12-04 11:48:40	ray_caster	and so on
2014-12-04 11:48:48	ray_caster	only integer multiples
2014-12-04 11:49:20	ray_caster	however, it's not rendering correctly at 1:1, nor at 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1 as pictured
2014-12-04 11:49:50	AbigailBuccaneer	does your code account for the half-texel offset?
2014-12-04 11:50:02	ray_caster	not that I'm aware...
2014-12-04 11:50:59	AbigailBuccaneer	if you want to get the value of the bottom-left, you should sample the texture with coordinates (0.5,0.5)/textureSize, not (0.0, 0.0)
2014-12-04 11:51:52	ray_caster	interesting... I'll see what I can do based off of that, and I'll get back to you

2014-12-04 16:00:33	Stragus	That's what the channel is for
2014-12-04 16:00:42	Gaulois94	I don't understand how to use glVertexAttribPointer
2014-12-04 16:00:46	Gaulois94	I tried something like this :
2014-12-04 16:01:07	Gaulois94	http://pastebin.com/wMBhDhbQ  I load with that
2014-12-04 16:01:28	Gaulois94	And I render with that : http://pastebin.com/MyFLmPUj
2014-12-04 16:02:07	Gaulois94	My VBO has the following pattern : PxPyPzPxPyPzPxPyPzNxNyNzNxNyNzNxNyNz
2014-12-04 16:02:13	Gaulois94	with P=position, and N=normal
2014-12-04 16:03:15	Stragus	Looks okay so far, although there's a bunch of Javascript-specific stuff I'm not familiar with
2014-12-04 16:03:20	derhass	Gaulois94: and what is the issue with VertexAttribPointer?
2014-12-04 16:03:40	derhass	the code pasted so far does not even have those calls
2014-12-04 16:03:54	Stragus	The second paste does
2014-12-04 16:04:12	Gaulois94	Sorry, it is with java for android, maybe it is my devise whose has problems. The issue is the following : my Triangle Position depends on the second given ptr
2014-12-04 16:04:52	Gaulois94	derhass: the code by himself is used for an OBJwrapper. I past only the VBO's loading and the VertexAttribLoading
2014-12-04 16:05:13	ClaudiusMaximus	is the vbo bound when you set the attrib pointers?
2014-12-04 16:07:01	Gaulois94	yep, the code by himself is that : http://pastebin.com/3Jtj162q

2014-12-04 16:07:55	Gaulois94	Well, my shape should be a sphere
2014-12-04 16:08:39	Gaulois94	If I change for example currentDatas.vertexPositionLength*4 by currentDatas.vertexPositionLength, My sphere will appear (yes, with the *4, I don't have any sphere on the screen)

2014-12-04 16:10:41	Gaulois94	The size of a float on Java is 4 bytes
2014-12-04 16:10:52	Stragus	I'm from Quebec but let's stick to english for everyone. :) In Java, is array.length a measure of items or bytes?
2014-12-04 16:11:14	derhass	Gaulois94: hmmmm. that sounds like some mismatch between the attrib locations
2014-12-04 16:11:28	Gaulois94	array.length is the measure of items
2014-12-04 16:11:59	Stragus	Can we see the shader?
2014-12-04 16:12:01	Gaulois94	derhass: I agree, I don't know where it is. I checked by hands (with cubes and an OBJ file more easy to read) is vertexPositionArray and vertexNormalArray are good

2014-12-04 16:45:46	Stragus	I would say sizeof() in C on Android, this is more a Java question than an Android one
2014-12-04 16:45:48	bob_twinkles	i.e. the same as the java primitive type
2014-12-04 16:46:20	Stragus	I think the question was related to the lack of sizeof() in Java
2014-12-04 16:46:29	Gaulois94	a really lack of sizeof

2014-12-04 16:53:51	bob_twinkles	Java wasn't designed for writing code as low level as the OpenGL APIs are
2014-12-04 16:54:27	Stragus	And how are you supposed to make your glVertexAttribPointer() calls? Guess the offsets and sizes?
2014-12-04 16:55:09	bob_twinkles	well, the java spec guarantees the size and layout of the primitive data types
2014-12-04 16:55:16	Gaulois94	I agree for the low level
2014-12-04 16:55:25	Gaulois94	But android impose java as the main language

2014-12-04 18:00:37	Codex_	doesnt java platform have text drawing on its own?
2014-12-04 18:01:06	Codex_	though dunno how it interacts with opengl code, whether its possible to render it to texture.

2014-12-04 18:05:57	Cooler	because its just stretching the texture to fit the traingle strip
2014-12-04 18:06:10	foobaz	resizing text is really hard, because text requires font hinting to look good
2014-12-04 18:06:27	Cooler	vector graphics solve this?
2014-12-04 18:06:31	foobaz	the easiest solution is to always show text at the same size you rendered it
2014-12-04 18:06:37	foobaz	no, vector graphics don?t have hinting
2014-12-04 18:06:51	Cooler	no i mean vector graphics to draw text
2014-12-04 18:07:04	foobaz	i know, but you need hinting
2014-12-04 18:07:42	foobaz	the feature sizes of letters are small
2014-12-04 18:07:52	Cooler	Well just scaling the traingles should work then?
2014-12-04 18:08:09	foobaz	i?m not sure you understand what font hinting is or what it does for you
2014-12-04 18:08:31	Cooler	you mean font size and style?
2014-12-04 18:08:35	foobaz	no
2014-12-04 18:09:00	foobaz	it aligns the vector shapes to pixel boundaries to fix blurry edges and make the text crisp
2014-12-04 18:09:29	foobaz	antialiased edges are nice on models and anything else that takes up a lot of pixels on screen
2014-12-04 18:10:06	foobaz	but the shapes in letters are only one or two pixels wide, if the edges are antialiased that blurs most of the letter
2014-12-04 18:10:40	foobaz	btw i believe lack of hinting is why vector graphics never took off for icons and other UI stuff
2014-12-04 18:10:55	foobaz	vector graphics are just too blurry unless you draw them at large size
2014-12-04 18:11:48	foobaz	valve has a really innovative solution to this, they published a paper: http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf

2014-12-04 18:13:06	foobaz	the easy way is to let freetype do the hinting, but that means you have to display the bitmap it gives you at the exact same size and using GL_NEAREST filtering to make sure it?s pixel-for-pixel identical with no resampling
2014-12-04 18:13:38	Cooler	foobaz: is freetype c++ only?
2014-12-04 18:13:47	Stragus	If your texcoords are okay, GL_LINEAR should do as well. GL_NEAREST is slower on some hardware
2014-12-04 18:13:50	foobaz	i think it?s C
2014-12-04 18:15:07	foobaz	it doesn?t have to be freetype, that?s just one popular one, it could be harfbuzz, coretext, or any decent text rendering API, they all do hinting

2014-12-04 18:34:23	Cooler	foobaz: if they are constant then i would have to use seperate draw calls for text and object?
2014-12-04 18:34:43	foobaz	that is one way to handle it
2014-12-04 18:34:50	foobaz	another way is vertex attributes
2014-12-04 18:34:56	Cooler	also the different text could have different colors, so that even more draw calls

2014-12-04 23:15:52	Stragus	glYoda, I had done some testing, years ago admittingly, in a scenario where both GL_NEAREST and GL_LINEAR could be used for the same results
2014-12-04 23:16:05	Stragus	And GL_LINEAR was faster than GL_NEAREST on the Nvidia hardware I had at hand
2014-12-04 23:16:33	glYoda	meh I'd need to see more data
2014-12-04 23:16:36	axion	Bloodust: you around?
2014-12-04 23:16:44	glYoda	I find that very unlikely tho
2014-12-04 23:16:55	glYoda	(at least without more context)
2014-12-04 23:16:57	keestu	hi, i have a generic question. I understand frame buffer is more than one collection of render buffer. My question is collection of render buffer represents a single image altogether ?
2014-12-04 23:17:02	Stragus	I assumed that GL_LINEAR was just far more optimized in hardware than GL_NEAREST, which is less common
2014-12-04 23:17:10	glYoda	uh no
2014-12-04 23:17:41	glYoda	I'd be far more willing to accept a tiling difference or cache access pattern delta between the two
2014-12-04 23:17:51	glYoda	versus the underlying fetch
2014-12-04 23:18:37	glYoda	there is a fairly large amount of math involved with linear interpolation after all? and even when that resides directly in dedicated logic it isn't free :P
2014-12-04 23:19:07	bob_twinkles	kestasjk: what do you mean "single image?"
2014-12-04 23:19:36	keestu	bob_twinkles,  i mean complete image .
2014-12-04 23:19:57	keestu	bob_twinkles, i am thinging in terms of live streaming. :). kindly correct me if i am wrong ? :)
2014-12-04 23:20:39	Stragus	glYoda, I have no knowledge of the underlying reasons :), I can only claim that GL_NEAREST appeared faster than GL_LINEAR on a geforce 7600 in various circumstances
2014-12-04 23:20:51	Stragus	It was indeed several years ago
2014-12-04 23:21:10	Stragus	Oops, other way around, I meant GL_LINEAR faster than GL_NEAREST
2014-12-04 23:21:54	bob_twinkles	keestu: describe your question using terminology from https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Framebuffer_Object ?
2014-12-04 23:22:02	glYoda	as I said earlier I'd need to see more data before I'd ever be willing to accept that
2014-12-04 23:22:21	glYoda	specifically on such ancient (utterly ancient?) HW heh

2014-12-04 23:31:12	bob_twinkles	check "save normals" (or something like that) and "triangulate mesh"
2014-12-04 23:31:22	bob_twinkles	knowing the mesh is all triangles makes parsing soo much easier
2014-12-04 23:31:39	axion	i checked triangulate...but i didnt think i needed normals without lighting for a simple test

2014-12-05 01:11:48	nnesse	Anyway, I was motivated to try to make an optimal font render because I noticed everything that I could find was trying to do a lot of work per character or wasn't using an atlas or looked like throw away code.
2014-12-05 01:13:09	nnesse	freetype-gl came very close to what I wanted but was still using OpenGL 2.x and I didn't care much for it's C API
2014-12-05 01:14:33	Stragus	An API written in C can be used from pretty much any language, that's how all APIs should be designed (in my opinion anyway)

2014-12-05 01:16:15	Codex_	but that can be done by prerendering the alphabet
2014-12-05 01:16:48	Stragus	You should prerender the base alphabet, and only add unusual Unicode symbols on the fly when required
2014-12-05 01:17:08	nnesse	I agree in principle but at some point you want an intuitive API and I felt to get that with freetype-gl I would have to make a C++ wrapper

2014-12-05 01:17:29	Codex_	prerendering works well with english or western alphabets, but its more problematic if you want to support chinese text
2014-12-05 01:18:05	nnesse	Since I already wanted to see what interesting things I could do with OpenGL 3.x and freetype-gl wasn't doing that it was enough for me to want to do it myself
2014-12-05 01:18:27	nnesse	Perhaps is overkill but I'm using a geometry shader to generate the quads
2014-12-05 01:19:11	nnesse	Texture buffers to lookup glyph information so all you pass in an array of points with glyph numbers and positions
2014-12-05 01:20:46	chrisf	nnesse: if you have reasonable bounds on glyph size it might be interesting to compare your GS solution with a pointsprite-based one
2014-12-05 01:20:50	nnesse	The way I set it up you can even render multiple lines of text in multiple colors and font styles with a single draw call
2014-12-05 01:20:56	bookmark	you have to encode the chars as integers though don't you?
2014-12-05 01:21:14	bookmark	of the string to be displayed

2014-12-05 01:21:57	nnesse	I thought it might but it must be shadowed in some way because it gave me a %20 boost

2014-12-05 01:38:30	chrisf	nnesse: pretty much -- and you take a bunch of complexity on your side to make that happen
2014-12-05 01:38:36	ESphynx	neure: ah nice. thanks. know if that's in GL ES 2?
2014-12-05 01:38:48	neure	mm maybe not

2014-12-05 01:39:09	neure	you can manually add border though
2014-12-05 01:39:13	neure	and use clamp to border
2014-12-05 01:39:13	nnesse	yeah I'd basically have to have two independent rendering implementations

2014-12-05 01:41:01	neure	what would you prefer instead?
2014-12-05 01:41:24	glYoda	neure if the spec was sensible it would ONLY define (0,0,0,0) and (0,0,0,1) respectively for border color
2014-12-05 01:41:28	ESphynx	I was seeing that as a potential solution to rendering a square portion of my mesh...

2014-12-05 01:42:13	neure	border color will take lots of bits from texture descriptor
2014-12-05 01:42:27	glYoda	you'd be shocked by how broken that happens to be across any number of different vendors / ASICs / drivers etc.
2014-12-05 01:42:36	nnesse	chrisf: I wasn't aware of that. Still it would mostly be a teaching exercise. What 3.x drivers have buffer storage that you know of?

2014-12-05 01:43:45	glYoda	ESphynx well if you need a border wrap mode short of using a mask you'd likely end up conditionalizing this within the shader
2014-12-05 01:44:06	ESphynx	shaders, right :P
2014-12-05 01:44:16	chrisf	nnesse: we enable it on all generations on the intel linux driver, iirc. the other open drivers mostly do too.
2014-12-05 01:44:21	glYoda	i.e. IF (coords OP reference value) specify border
2014-12-05 01:44:48	neure	which means .. shader recompilation when texture/sampler changes..

2014-12-05 01:45:18	glYoda	yes
2014-12-05 01:45:24	ESphynx	would there be a way to use multiple textures for a same mesh?
2014-12-05 01:45:29	glYoda	it's still something you'd have to concern yourself with tho
2014-12-05 01:45:30	ESphynx	with the shaders?
2014-12-05 01:45:42	ESphynx	say I want to use 4x4 textures?
2014-12-05 01:46:00	neure	with shaders you can trivially use multiple textures
2014-12-05 01:46:26	glYoda	umm multitexture is trivial with the programmable pipeline
2014-12-05 01:46:26	ESphynx	side by side as opposed to blending together
2014-12-05 01:46:29	chrisf	glYoda: GL_CLAMP is pure evil; you're not a fan of GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER either?
2014-12-05 01:46:31	foobaz	if you want to use 4x4 textures, put them inside a 6x6 texture so they can have a border
2014-12-05 01:46:33	glYoda	I'm not sure why you'd think otherwise
2014-12-05 01:46:54	ESphynx	that is 16 different textures
2014-12-05 01:47:06	glYoda	chrisf a fair amount of GL state is laughably stupid? welcome to reality :P

2014-12-05 01:52:30	nnesse	the spec doesn't give much insight as far as I can tell, except to say that the image sizes at least 1024x1024 are supported

2014-12-05 01:53:18	neure	i would pack more glyphs per layer
2014-12-05 01:53:22	bookmark	I'd like to know.
2014-12-05 01:53:26	neure	different glyphs have different sizes
2014-12-05 01:53:36	glYoda	bookmark it's utterly ancient? so ancient that it's really not worth my time
2014-12-05 01:53:41	neure	thus you would waste a lot of space if all layers were the maximum size
2014-12-05 01:54:08	bookmark	So it will be slow at certain things or they just won't look as good?
2014-12-05 01:54:13	glYoda	the feature set is lame, the performance consequences of that particular environment (due to security concerns) are lame etc. etc.
2014-12-05 01:54:18	nnesse	glYoda: I understand what you mean about the packing and the implementation variability, I was just wondering if anyone had done some first hand experiments on it that they could share
2014-12-05 01:54:41	neure	glYoda, security concerns are real though
2014-12-05 01:54:57	glYoda	neure ? ?I never said they weren't

2014-12-05 01:55:55	neure	webgl is better than flash imho
2014-12-05 01:56:13	nnesse	I just went with 1024 because the spec said it would be supported, I was just curious about the extreme case, I might do a test of it if I get bored

2014-12-05 02:01:30	foobaz	is the goal to saturate all GPU cores even for small scenes? otherwise there would not be enough tiles for all the cores?

2014-12-05 02:04:38	foobaz	i don't think my company has ever come across an iOS opengl bug, whereas on android we have several hacks in place to deal with this driver or that
2014-12-05 02:05:19	neure	plenty of "opengl bugs" are actually incorrect API use :/
2014-12-05 02:05:26	glYoda	yep

2014-12-05 02:08:04	nnesse	It just didn't synchonize to the fence. Got the vendor on phone eventually and they pretty much said "yeah, we didn't really do that"

2014-12-05 02:58:08	chrisf	the emerging approach on desktop is to use shader load/store + an extension to impose partial ordering on FS invocations
2014-12-05 02:58:10	glYoda	through unordered buffers
2014-12-05 02:58:21	glYoda	chrisf as I just said
2014-12-05 02:59:06	glYoda	and depending upon the HW one wishes to target that amount of synchronization required on that front might be minimal to begin with
2014-12-05 02:59:16	glYoda	(at least in terms of what would be expected from the client)
2014-12-05 03:00:00	glYoda	NV_texture_barrier is another approach to this problem
2014-12-05 03:00:19	glYoda	and not terribly heavy handed on most HW
2014-12-05 03:01:17	neure	glYoda, atomics didnt quarantee ordering of everything though?
2014-12-05 03:01:34	glYoda	in any case shared memory and coherent L2 is all you'll need? assuming you're willing to sacrifice performance in certain cases

2014-12-05 03:02:53	neure	yeah but i thought atomics alone were not enough

2014-12-05 03:06:20	chrisf	neure: you can certainly build locks which do what you want with image atomics. NV_fragment_shader_interlock & INTEL_fragment_shader_ordering may be able to do something cleverer
2014-12-05 03:06:53	neure	right, so these extensions are just performance optimizations?
2014-12-05 03:06:58	glYoda	neure yes one could do all of this explicitly through the existing shader load / store / atomic operation set
2014-12-05 03:07:07	glYoda	the ONLY difference here is WRT performance
2014-12-05 03:07:19	Stragus	These extensions probably create something less ugly than atomic spin locks

2014-12-05 03:08:11	neure	yeah based on implementation details you can do sycnhronization more efficiently
2014-12-05 03:08:40	glYoda	well it's just a matter of what path one targets in the HW
2014-12-05 03:09:51	glYoda	in any case as I said earlier being able to effectively "order" an unordered resource comes somewhat naturally once you have shared memory / atomics and a coherent L2 (from a HW perspective)
2014-12-05 03:10:41	glYoda	you have nearly everything you'd need to accomplish that task in the HW at that point? it's just a matter of making it optimal hehe
2014-12-05 03:11:07	neure	gets tricky on tile based architecture though
2014-12-05 03:11:25	neure	can you even do fragment shader image load/store on tile based architecture?
2014-12-05 03:11:33	glYoda	well tilers are in their own class on this front
2014-12-05 03:12:14	glYoda	you have a nice and fast L2 you can work with (at least for the blending case noted earlier)
2014-12-05 03:12:27	neure	but you cant do tiling any more
2014-12-05 03:12:41	neure	you need to rasterize primitives and do their image loads/stores in order
2014-12-05 03:12:45	neure	right?
2014-12-05 03:13:06	glYoda	for image load / store you'll screw yourself (at least without being clever?) paging
2014-12-05 03:13:21	glYoda	exactly? hence the paging case
2014-12-05 03:13:29	glYoda	which is nasty? terribly nasty
2014-12-05 03:13:43	glYoda	there are ways to work around that to various extents tho

2014-12-05 10:40:00	AbigailBuccaneer	ali1234, the SDL2 window creation will use a platform-specific GL thing under the hood - glx, wgl, etc.
2014-12-05 10:40:13	ali1234	yeah, i suspect it is using the wrong one
2014-12-05 10:40:21	AbigailBuccaneer	i know SDL supports android so presumably it does also support egl, but figuring out how to force that is an sdl-specific task
2014-12-05 10:40:32	ali1234	yes, exactly
2014-12-05 10:40:37	ali1234	i'm trying to port my old game to android :)
2014-12-05 10:40:45	ali1234	this means fixing it to work with ES
2014-12-05 10:41:15	AbigailBuccaneer	back in my day we didn't have emulators, we had to build and deploy for each small fix and it was mind-numbingly slow :(
2014-12-05 10:41:22	ali1234	so far i've rewritten it to use only ES1.1 functions, and compile with ES headers, but if i link against ESv1 i get a black screen. if i link against GL it works
2014-12-05 10:41:42	Match	AbigailBuccaneer, well, I can see my simple objects, I assume shader is loaded and linked
2014-12-05 10:42:00	ali1234	and i think you're right, SDL is assuming i want desktop GL internally

2014-12-05 10:42:49	AbigailBuccaneer	ali1234, ES1.1? either you've just taken a huge step back, or your old game really was old

2014-12-05 14:34:45	aethersis	that's it
2014-12-05 14:35:08	aethersis	it simply means that you can't transform the equation to get an exact solution in given time
2014-12-05 14:35:20	bookmark	well about the bipedal sim i think bezier curves could handle it
2014-12-05 14:35:25	aethersis	you can for example solve 3x = 6 => x=2

2014-12-05 14:36:36	Stragus	You can solve it by making certain assumptions to linearize, which makes the resulting sstem of equations work for certain cases

2014-12-05 14:40:40	bookmark	fluid does not require a gas it could be in space and don't say fluid is a gas because not all fluids are
2014-12-05 14:41:17	aethersis	going back to the pressure, for uniform grid, s=1 = const, m is related to density and a is related to velocity since it's dV/dt
2014-12-05 14:41:28	bookmark	you could have to take the tension between the two fluids into account
2014-12-05 14:41:35	aethersis	so there's a beautiful mutual relationship between pressure and velocity and density, namely continuity equation

2014-12-05 15:03:44	Stragus	Pressure is moles*R*temperature/volume
2014-12-05 15:03:56	Stragus	Momentum is force * time

2014-12-05 15:04:56	aethersis	yes and physically pressure is also force/area !
2014-12-05 15:05:20	bookmark	but one would modify existing geometry no? i mean surely the surface isn't mathematical alone there are parts that are just computer related and nothing to do with math such as unmangling topologies
2014-12-05 15:05:21	aethersis	so this damn nRT/V can be derived from force/area or vice versa!
2014-12-05 15:05:40	Stragus	But force is defined by pressure, not the other way around
2014-12-05 15:06:10	aethersis	ok, but pressure is defined by density and velocity, isn't it?
2014-12-05 15:06:25	Stragus	No, pressure is defined by moles and temperature

2014-12-05 15:36:56	Yaniel	maybe
2014-12-05 15:37:13	japro	i didn't bench it but it seems likely
2014-12-05 15:37:43	japro	if you assume the two vectors are normalized you only have one division (otherwise two and a sqrt or an rsqrt)
2014-12-05 15:38:01	japro	which are still drastically faster than sin/cos
2014-12-05 15:38:37	japro	i guess there is also the cost of a dot and a cross product
2014-12-05 15:38:52	japro	but those should also be cheap compared to the trig
2014-12-05 15:38:58	Yaniel	dirt cheap
2014-12-05 15:39:04	aethersis	I realised that sinf() computes faster on my CPU than getting the value from a lookup table XD
2014-12-05 15:39:25	aethersis	it's incredible
2014-12-05 15:39:28	Stragus	Is the lookup table small and cached?

2014-12-05 15:39:46	Stragus	Okay, I'm surprised... :)
2014-12-05 15:39:50	japro	my general assumption is that sin/cos/tan/exp/log take about 100cycles (in a throughput sense), sqrt and div 10, and mul and add are borderline free

2014-12-05 16:18:40	axion	everything so far has been hard for me...this is new. everything's easy once you know how to do it. it took me over a week to learn matrix math
2014-12-05 16:19:01	japro	aaaah, the black screen yoga at the beginning of every gl project :D
2014-12-05 16:19:40	Codex_	you sometimes need to do the black screen even after years of work
2014-12-05 16:19:52	Yaniel	axion: I went for years knowing almost nothing about matrix math
2014-12-05 16:19:56	japro	do i have to link carmack again? :D

2014-12-05 16:51:31	Yaniel	a float or half-float png would be cool though
2014-12-05 16:52:01	aethersis	ther's 32bit png right?
2014-12-05 16:52:05	Yaniel	no
2014-12-05 16:52:09	aethersis	how come
2014-12-05 16:52:13	aethersis	3ds max had it in its render settings
2014-12-05 16:52:17	aethersis	or was it even 48 bit
2014-12-05 16:52:20	Yaniel	unless you mean 32bit as in rgba8
2014-12-05 16:52:27	derhass	aethersis: 48 is just 3x16
2014-12-05 16:52:34	Yaniel	rgba16 is the highest it goes
2014-12-05 16:52:42	aethersis	so it's like half float, isnt it?
2014-12-05 16:52:42	Spark	float png is one of those hdr formats right?
2014-12-05 16:52:42	Yaniel	the png spec, that is
2014-12-05 16:52:46	Stragus	PNG allows 16 bits per channel
2014-12-05 16:52:51	Yaniel	there is no float png

2014-12-05 16:53:02	aethersis	but half ffloat has 16 bit right?
2014-12-05 16:53:02	Yaniel	openexr is probably what you are thinking of
2014-12-05 16:53:04	Spark	obviously not but a lossless float image format
2014-12-05 16:53:07	Spark	yeah
2014-12-05 16:53:16	Yaniel	yes, half-float is 16bit
2014-12-05 16:53:27	Spark	i made luaimg dump float files in its own format though
2014-12-05 16:53:28	Yaniel	and yes you could pack that into rgba16
2014-12-05 16:53:32	Spark	just a raw block of floats
2014-12-05 16:53:36	Yaniel	but it wouldn't probably compress very well
2014-12-05 16:53:37	Spark	called it .sfi
2014-12-05 16:53:37	aethersis	so be it an intiger which is 16 bit or half float which is 16 bit , it's kinda the same - same ammount of data that can be stored
2014-12-05 16:53:43	Yaniel	or actually it even might
2014-12-05 16:53:57	Yaniel	at least some of the time
2014-12-05 16:54:19	Yaniel	just don't expect anything but your custom code to be able to read it as intended
2014-12-05 16:54:45	japro	it seems most editing software can't even deal with 16bit...
2014-12-05 16:54:50	Yaniel	yup
2014-12-05 16:55:24	antto	color processing with integers is just not fun
2014-12-05 16:55:31	Yaniel	btw the openexr format looks scary as heck

2014-12-05 16:58:29	japro	i guess for hdr rendering a float format might make sense... for regular image data captured from some device it doesn't
2014-12-05 16:58:57	japro	since those (scanners or digicams) usually only produce 12-14bit of useful dynamic range anyway
2014-12-05 16:59:18	Yaniel	argh they use the same content renderer for xcode and safari it seems
2014-12-05 16:59:30	Yaniel	now xcode freezes randomly too
2014-12-05 16:59:51	derhass	cmos/ccd sensors have a nearly linear transfer function anyway
2014-12-05 17:01:27	Spark	even if it's not linear you can make it linear

2014-12-05 17:54:03	newguise1234	when using instances, you can for example have a vbo that will repeat per instance, can one set up a vbo that steps through per vertex, but continues stepping at the end of an instance?
2014-12-05 17:54:08	newguise1234	instead of looping to the beginning?
2014-12-05 17:55:57	roboman2444	unlikely
2014-12-05 17:56:28	newguise1234	thats what it was looking like, was just thinking of drawing instances and having a "deformation buffer" that it stepped through as well
2014-12-05 17:57:10	slime	you could use a uniform buffer object or texture buffer object and index into it using gl_VertexID and gl_InstanceID
