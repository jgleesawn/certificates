2014-11-24 14:51:32	newguise1234	ya'll might get asked this a lot, but what does bullet3 have that bullet2 doesn't? is it difficult to upgrade to bullet3 from bullet2?
2014-11-24 14:52:05	newguise1234	I'm asking because my laptop does not have opencl support.  My desktop does, but I'm having some problems getting the bullet3 demos to work.
2014-11-24 14:52:37	newguise1234	I would like to use bullet3 with its opencl support in the future, but for the time being I was hoping to get something working that would run on my laptop

2014-11-27 18:58:55	Skwint	mostly this chat room is about people asking for help with obscure compiler errors getting bullet working
2014-11-27 18:59:02	Skwint	occasionally it is also about the answer
2014-11-27 18:59:44	Skwint	bulletphysics is a game physics engine, not a physics of rapidly rotating pointy projectiles :)
2014-11-27 19:00:36	Skwint	infact, ironically, in a game involving lots of bullets, the bullets would be one of the few things bulletphysics would be very VERY bad at

2014-11-29 08:30:52	ison	Hello. How to stop movement of btKinematicCharacterController? I used setWalkDirection but now I can't stop it
2014-11-29 09:16:28	-->	Skwint (~Skwint@82-69-66-224.dsl.in-addr.zen.co.uk) has joined #bulletphysics
2014-11-29 11:01:26	serengeor	ison, how about giving it btVector(0,0,0)?
2014-11-29 11:01:56	ison	serengeor I tried, but then bullet gives failed assertion, length() != btScalar(0)
2014-11-29 11:02:06	serengeor	uhh, I see
2014-11-29 11:02:18	ison	but I think it can be a bug https://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=785
2014-11-29 11:02:20	serengeor	I haven't really used it, so I was just guessing
2014-11-29 11:03:17	ison	that's the proper way to do it according to the documentation, but there's this assert which shouldn't be there
2014-11-29 11:03:21	ison	I'm using bullet 2.82
2014-11-29 11:03:45	serengeor	I see, it might be a bug then
2014-11-29 11:04:18	serengeor	I've never used kinematic controller myself though
2014-11-29 11:04:35	ison	what did you use to move player?
2014-11-29 11:05:30	serengeor	at the time I was using bullet I didn't have much done, but afaik I just used dynamic rigid body
2014-11-29 11:05:48	ison	btw. are there any obvious optimization tricks? because currently if I add 20 kinematic character controllers then I get like 5 fps
2014-11-29 11:06:53	serengeor	did you measure if it's the physics side that takes most of the time?
2014-11-29 11:07:00	Skwint	I move the player by having a sphere on his feet
2014-11-29 11:07:10	Skwint	it has high friction and a high torque motor, but low top speed
2014-11-29 11:07:39	Skwint	there are good points and bad points to this - one of the good points is I don't have any kinematic controllers :)
2014-11-29 11:07:42	ison	I'm pretty sure, because the only thing that slowed app down was adding character controllers to the world, nothing more
2014-11-29 11:08:35	ison	Skwint sphere is just a shape, then it can be attached either to rigidbody or character controller
2014-11-29 11:08:53	Skwint	yeah, but I move by rotating it
2014-11-29 11:09:04	ison	rotating?
2014-11-29 11:09:07	ison	how?
2014-11-29 11:09:08	Skwint	so the character is more like a monocycle
2014-11-29 11:09:19	ison	hmm, clever
2014-11-29 11:09:25	Skwint	it reacts well to ice on the floor
2014-11-29 11:09:29	serengeor	Skwint, hehe, quite a solution :D
2014-11-29 11:09:50	Skwint	if you try to run off a chair it tends to push the chair backwards, which is what would actually happen in real life
2014-11-29 11:09:52	ison	does it produce good results?
2014-11-29 11:09:54	Skwint	but not what most players expect :)
2014-11-29 11:10:15	serengeor	currently I'm just doing my own aabb collisions, but can't get swept collisions working with my voxel level :[
2014-11-29 11:10:26	ison	in my game, player will mostly be walking on a terrain, so this means I can't have any weirdness going on if someone tries to go up hill
2014-11-29 11:10:26	Skwint	I like the results, but if you run really hard at a wall sometimes the "not-quite-rigid" joint makes the feet hit the wall and throw you up it
2014-11-29 11:11:08	Skwint	I'd quite like to see a specialized "feet" object that had a fake velocity, so I could make the feet any shape and stationary, and just insert a friction force during the calculations
2014-11-29 11:11:50	ison	ehh, I guess I'll also have to use plain rigid bodies instead of character controller, because performance is very poor
2014-11-29 11:11:51	Skwint	not sure how well it climbs steps
2014-11-29 11:12:12	Skwint	I always struggle with these systems that apply a force to the character, like it's some sort of jet plane
2014-11-29 11:12:15	Skwint	I can never make it feel right
2014-11-29 11:12:59	ison	with rigid bodies performance isn't that good either, for 50 balls, fps starts to decrease drastically. Should I use a custom broadphase and all other algorithms? Because I use custom ones
2014-11-29 11:13:03	ison	I mean default ones*
2014-11-29 11:13:13	serengeor	http://puu.sh/dadiu/413bd8f9b2.png
2014-11-29 11:13:17	Skwint	bullet should handle 50 balls out of the box :/
2014-11-29 11:13:44	Skwint	that's a lot of painfully textured voxels :p
2014-11-29 11:13:56	serengeor	haha, it's not textures tho
2014-11-29 11:13:57	serengeor	:)
2014-11-29 11:14:24	Skwint	http://www.euclidsmouse.com/euclidsmouse/gallery2.png
2014-11-29 11:14:34	Skwint	mine are textures, but not very good ones
2014-11-29 11:14:34	serengeor	each voxel has blue color and shader does the lines, that's why there's that moire effect
2014-11-29 11:15:11	serengeor	looks nice Skwint :)
2014-11-29 11:15:24	Skwint	you could make the shader use a slightly different shade of blue for each voxel
2014-11-29 11:15:31	Skwint	some sort of hash of its world coordinates
2014-11-29 11:15:45	serengeor	Skwint, I bet you could tell what level my screenshot uses if it wasn't single collored :)
2014-11-29 11:15:45	ison	this is how I init world, do I do something wrong that I get so poor performance? https://ideone.com/Lrfea5
2014-11-29 11:16:37	Skwint	I'm not an expert on which broadphases are good - have you tried profiling it?
2014-11-29 11:16:38	serengeor	I wrote blender plugin that exports voxel shell for triangle meshes, so that level is taken from some other game :)
2014-11-29 11:16:49	Skwint	novel approach
2014-11-29 11:16:56	Skwint	I wrote a voxel level editor and built it into my game
2014-11-29 11:17:04	ison	profiling? I guess the only useful information I would get is that stepping simulation is slow
2014-11-29 11:17:14	Skwint	it should tell you which bit is slow
2014-11-29 11:17:24	Skwint	no point tweaking the broadphase if it's 1% of the time
2014-11-29 11:17:35	serengeor	I wrote exporter only because I was too lazy to make my own levels :D
2014-11-29 11:17:48	Skwint	mines a puzzle game - I kind of needed my own levels :)
2014-11-29 11:17:56	serengeor	I see :)
2014-11-29 11:18:38	Skwint	really must get it finished!
2014-11-29 11:18:40	serengeor	Skwint, I'm thinking of remaking some game mod that I used to play, so I wanted to have something from that game
2014-11-29 11:18:53	ison	hmm, ok then, I just hope that I won't go below 30 fps after I add many static objects to my world
2014-11-29 11:19:56	serengeor	btw, that level in screenshot is de_nuke from counterstrike 1.6 :)
2014-11-29 11:20:33	ison	is there no mipmapping?
2014-11-29 11:20:55	serengeor	ison, huh?
2014-11-29 11:21:07	ison	looks like if there was no mipmapping on the screenshot
2014-11-29 11:21:36	serengeor	my screenshot? it's probably cause it's not using any textures :D
2014-11-29 11:22:02	ison	no textures? I thought the black borders were from the texture
2014-11-29 11:22:03	serengeor	can't mipmap if there's no texture on object, right?
2014-11-29 11:22:12	serengeor	ison, nope :)
2014-11-29 11:22:19	ison	ye
2014-11-29 11:23:21	serengeor	ison, https://github.com/Murloc992/ZombieGameProject/blob/voxmesh_opt/res/engine/shaders/solid_cube.frag
2014-11-29 11:23:34	ison	I see
2014-11-29 11:24:19	serengeor	I won't be using textures unless after I add colors to voxels it will feel like the detail level is not enough
2014-11-29 11:25:02	serengeor	I'm going to make voxels smaller in future, so I think it should be enough
2014-11-29 12:17:22	Skwint	Any particular reason for doing it with voxels?
2014-11-29 12:17:27	Skwint	you just like the idea?
2014-11-29 12:17:48	Skwint	I've been considering trying to render an entire level as particles ... so long as they are really small they are basically cheap voxels ;)
2014-11-29 12:18:09	serengeor	Skwint, well, I wasn't really into minecraft and all that, but voxels are indeed interesting concept
2014-11-29 12:18:12	Skwint	but because there's no triangulation pass I should be able to make it really really dynamic
2014-11-29 12:18:31	serengeor	and I feel that it's going to be used more widelly in future
2014-11-29 12:18:34	Skwint	I worry that they would flicker near the edges as you moved
2014-11-29 12:19:31	serengeor	Skwint, well I was considering making a software voxel renderer, but I realized I don't really have that much time and knowledge to do it :)
2014-11-29 12:20:52	serengeor	you could probably render voxels with geometry shaders, but I've heard it's not that much better than just generating the meshes
2014-11-29 12:22:19	serengeor	Skwint, have you seen cube2 engine?
2014-11-29 12:23:29	serengeor	I liked that approach on levels, can have quite detailed levels while still using "cubes"
2014-11-29 12:23:50	Skwint	I haven't
2014-11-29 12:24:05	Skwint	but I don't see why mere cubes shouldn't become very detailed
2014-11-29 12:24:33	Skwint	I can also see a way you could raytrace them really really fast which might be interesting
2014-11-29 12:25:00	Skwint	you could fake the normal at the surface so it looked smooth very easily
2014-11-29 12:26:10	serengeor	Skwint, yeah
2014-11-29 12:26:31	serengeor	also this looks very nice: http://www.atomontage.com/
2014-11-29 12:26:34	 *	Skwint wonders if overlapping spheres would be easier
2014-11-29 12:27:41	Skwint	that's quite impressive
2014-11-29 12:29:15	serengeor	yeah, it is, but the devs aren't updating the website with news and info about the engine
2014-11-29 12:30:09	serengeor	I've known it for like 2 years and there was barelly any public updates on the progress, which is a bit dissapointing
2014-11-29 12:38:35	serengeor	Skwint, looks like the twitter page has a bit more news :)

2014-11-29 15:50:30	serengeor	newguise1234, triangle mesh still has btRigidBody, doesn't it?
2014-11-29 15:50:38	newguise1234	yes
2014-11-29 15:50:48	newguise1234	I did try setRestitution, but the boxes are not bouncing off
2014-11-29 15:51:12	serengeor	hmm, maybe it works only one way
2014-11-29 15:51:14	newguise1234	I set it to 100.0f, thinking that would be enough to see some drastic changes
2014-11-29 15:51:16	newguise1234	k
2014-11-29 15:51:33	newguise1234	(given I was seeing drastic changes on setting boxes to 2.0f)
2014-11-29 16:05:10	Squint	it might be the arbitrary mesh it doesn't like - does making a very big box instead of a mesh work?
2014-11-29 16:05:31	Squint	After that I'd be tempted to poke around in the source code and make it work :p
2014-11-29 16:05:55	newguise1234	I'll try that
2014-11-29 16:05:56	Squint	I did that for the friction, because it was really silly :)
2014-11-29 16:05:59	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-29 16:13:44	newguise1234	it looks like setting the restitution of a btStaticPlaneShape isn't doing much of anything either, nor a btBoxShape
2014-11-29 16:14:06	newguise1234	so I'm guessing the bounce velocity is based upon the bouncing object's restitution solely
2014-11-29 16:15:56	newguise1234	nvm, if I set the restitution of the box and of the falling boxes, then they bounce
2014-11-29 16:16:15	newguise1234	I guess both colliding objects must have a restitution set for it to affect their collision
2014-11-29 16:17:38	newguise1234	thanks for the suggestion
2014-11-29 16:25:20	Squint	well, for friction, it multiplies the two together
2014-11-29 16:25:35	Squint	I bet it does something similar here - after all, a really bouncy ball hitting a sponge won't bounce
2014-11-29 16:26:51	Squint	friction allows you to specify an override so that you can choose the friction yourself based on the two objects
2014-11-29 16:27:02	Squint	it may already also have that for resti, or you could add it
2014-11-29 16:29:16	newguise1234	that makes sense, I guess I assumed it would have a default restitution, but maybe the default behaviour is to not utilize something that isn't set
2014-11-29 16:30:34	newguise1234	nvm, I'm gonna stop positing stuff, if the default values are 0, then a multiplication would send it to 0

2014-11-30 14:44:26	newguise1234	I'm very glad for the function, but getting the coordinates of the collision object is less useful for me than getting the index of it

2014-11-30 17:06:16	newguise1234	I'm not entirely sure what the difference between m_optionalMotionState and m_worldTransform are
2014-11-30 17:07:16	newguise1234	so far I've just used btDefaultMotionState as the base class for my objects, but it seems I could just get the m_worldTransform of a rigidBody
2014-11-30 17:07:28	newguise1234	instead of calling getWorldTransform on a motion state
2014-11-30 17:09:44	newguise1234	I guess m_worldTransform doesn't have a rotation aspect
2014-11-30 17:15:25	newguise1234	nevermind
2014-11-30 17:16:34	newguise1234	I guess my main question is, what would m_optionalMotionState be used for in btRigidBody, if anyone has used it

2014-12-02 13:56:02	serengeor	not really a bullet question, but please bare with me
2014-12-02 13:56:14	serengeor	 I'm trying to think how to make collision response for AABB vs AABB collisions ("static" voxel world and dynamic player).
2014-12-02 13:56:24	serengeor	currently I have swept collision checks, but I am not sure how to make response when there's more than one voxel colliding at a time
2014-12-02 13:56:34	serengeor	for example if I player is falling along side of wall I get ~6 voxels and collision normals point away from wall, but for bottom wall voxels it also gives normal in y+ axis
2014-12-02 13:56:53	serengeor	any ideas how should I approach this?

2014-12-05 00:56:21	Enhex	How do I fix the formal parameter with __declspec(align('16')) won't be aligned error?
2014-12-05 00:57:10	Enhex	I have a struct with a btManifoldPoint
2014-12-05 01:01:22	ecosky	sometimes alignment stuff can snowball up the callstack
2014-12-05 01:02:41	ecosky	could possibly make an alternate method that accepts non-aligned input and copies the parameters to aligned data for passing through to the method you are wrapping.
2014-12-05 01:22:55	Enhex	just trying to make a struct with btManifoldPoint in it
2014-12-05 01:28:03	Enhex	oh never mind, fixed it by using a reference for the constructor's paramteter
2014-12-05 01:42:10	Enhex	I think it was the constructor's copy that wasn't aligned
2014-12-05 01:52:00	ecosky	alignment can be tricky
