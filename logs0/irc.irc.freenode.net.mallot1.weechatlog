2014-11-30 00:35:55	newguise1234	can you link me your How to use the Public folder.txt?
2014-11-30 00:37:14	Mallot1	I don't know what you mean

2014-11-30 00:37:41	newguise1234	in Dropbox/Public there is a file called How to use the Public folder.txt
2014-11-30 00:37:51	newguise1234	I just used that as a test in an account I just set up and it worked
2014-11-30 00:38:01	newguise1234	I was wondering if you could send me a link to that to see if it would work
2014-11-30 00:38:18	newguise1234	it may be you have a business account and have set an expiration to the links you're handing out
2014-11-30 00:38:38	newguise1234	or a pro account
2014-11-30 00:39:22	Mallot1	I don'5 have a Public folder
