2014-11-30 02:08:29	ace4016	i have my three flight HIDs in along with my 360 controller and most games freak out about that
2014-11-30 02:08:42	ace4016	either have to disconnect the flight stuff or the 360 controller...

2014-11-30 02:17:36	wartech0	those things never fucking work right
2014-11-30 02:18:33	ace4016	actually, it works perfectly in all the games i've used it in so far, including Ys
2014-11-30 02:18:53	ace4016	this is just the first time i've had so many controllers plugged in
2014-11-30 02:19:29	ace4016	steam community post confirms the game just gets confused with multiple controllers :P
2014-11-30 02:19:41	ace4016	not sure what issues you've seen from it
2014-11-30 02:19:47	Sirisian	Ever since I've been using bagels as hamburger buns I haven't looked back. So much better.
2014-11-30 02:20:08	Sirisian	pretty close to pretzel buns
2014-11-30 02:20:13	Sirisian	ace4016, can you carry stuff?
2014-11-30 02:20:19	Sirisian	Do the pets like it?
2014-11-30 02:20:31	ace4016	it's a palm sized quadcopter
2014-11-30 02:20:36	ace4016	the pets are terrified of it
2014-11-30 02:20:42	ace4016	i chase them with it too :P
2014-11-30 02:21:23	Sirisian	I put a toy ball on a string and my cat would try to pull the toy helicopters down. It was fun trying to fight my cat like that.
2014-11-30 02:22:40	Sirisian	does yours have a camera?
2014-11-30 02:23:09	ace4016	no; decided not to get the model that does

If you have stereo data and SamplesNeeded is 1, you're writing two SWORDs, not four!", it's from here: https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Engine/Sound/USoundWaveStreaming/GeneratePCMData/index.html
2014-11-30 07:40:14	Tsarpf	why would a channel be two SWORDs?
2014-11-30 07:40:43	Tsarpf	when in the code it looks like it's int16 per sample (==channel)

2014-11-30 07:43:35	Tsarpf	well okay: no one answers there
2014-11-30 07:43:56	Shadowdancer	it doesn't make sense to write single samples to  multi-channel stream
2014-11-30 07:43:57	Tsarpf	I've succesfully got an answer or two here over the 2+ years I've (mostly idled) been here
2014-11-30 07:44:15	Tsarpf	hmm
2014-11-30 07:44:41	Tsarpf	true, but what does that "if samplesNeeded is 1, you're writing two, not four!" mean then?
2014-11-30 07:45:27	Shadowdancer	WTF kind of typedef is SWORD?
2014-11-30 07:45:51	Tsarpf	dunno :D 
2014-11-30 07:47:59	Shadowdancer	I don't think anything in that paragraph makes sense
2014-11-30 07:51:27	Tsarpf	yup yup.
2014-11-30 07:51:40	Shadowdancer	as I read it, you send <SamplesNeeded> 16bit signed integer samples and pray that your generator and the sink have the same channel layout and that it doesn't start requesting partial frames
2014-11-30 07:52:17	Shadowdancer	you can probably assert that SamplesNeeded is an integer multiple of your channel count

2014-11-30 07:53:34	Tsarpf	but I guess I should just test if it works like you said as soon as I have something to test it with..
2014-11-30 07:53:56	Shadowdancer	google search indicates that it's just some legacy naming from a time when people still thought that Windows type naming wasn't braincancer

2014-11-30 07:55:16	Tsarpf	but yeah thanks for the second opinion
2014-11-30 07:55:29	Shadowdancer	but it really doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. There's no world in which a sample format composed of two signed integers makes sense (unless you start doing weird shit sending complex numbers to the soundcard)

2014-11-30 08:41:16	mantis	especially the newer ones
2014-11-30 08:42:17	Sirisian	also I just realized they have new printers. When I researched this before they just had the one and twoup printers. hmm
2014-11-30 08:42:44	Sirisian	mantis, find a nearby maker faire when they have them.
2014-11-30 08:42:56	Sirisian	You can see a lot of these printers running at them.
2014-11-30 08:43:31	Sargon	What do you want to print though? Robotic parts?
2014-11-30 08:43:34	mantis	Sirisian: my hackerspace has couple, but it's, as mentioned in that post, couple hundred kms from here :/
2014-11-30 08:43:39	mantis	Sargon: among others
2014-11-30 08:44:07	Sirisian	Sargon, well he could make the servo arms for his robot to connect to the servos.
2014-11-30 08:44:13	Sargon	Best thing is to print figures of characters from your games, coat them with gold and sell them to your fans XD
2014-11-30 08:44:23	Sirisian	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDIyGCbPDWg <-- oneup printing.
2014-11-30 08:44:24	Sargon	servo?
2014-11-30 08:44:50	Sirisian	A servo is an motor connected to gears with a pentometer to measure the angle of the servo arm.
2014-11-30 08:45:31	mantis	indeed
2014-11-30 08:45:37	Sargon	Oh
2014-11-30 08:45:44	Sirisian	The arm can be moved to given positions through the use of a pulse width modulation pin. The integrated circuit in the servo translates the PWM to an angle and attempts to move the motor left or right.
2014-11-30 08:45:53	Sirisian	Rather nice packaged device.
2014-11-30 08:46:01	Sargon	I love the idea of 3D printing, though I am paranoid about the health issues. Like cancerous materials and fumes
2014-11-30 08:46:21	mantis	Sargon: don't print food utensils, and that should be enough
2014-11-30 08:46:36	mantis	legosperm ain't really bad if you don't ingest it
2014-11-30 08:46:46	Sargon	What if I touch something printed, and then eat pita?
2014-11-30 08:47:05	mantis	Sargon: nothing happens
2014-11-30 08:47:18	Sargon	What if some crumbs stick to my finger?
2014-11-30 08:47:36	Sargon	It has crumbs falling from it
2014-11-30 08:47:53	mantis	Sargon: only if you don't process it properly
2014-11-30 08:48:20	mantis	basically, if you process it with acetone, it's as bad for you as lego bricks, which is not much
2014-11-30 08:48:33	Sargon	DOn't trust what they print on the supermarket! Only print homemade printing XD
2014-11-30 08:48:57	Sirisian	mantis, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4t3zpH61k Trust me it's probably one of the best hobbyist printers.

2014-11-30 08:55:50	mantis	:/
2014-11-30 08:56:03	Sirisian	ABS isn't that common.
2014-11-30 08:56:49	Sirisian	Yeah you need a heatbed for that.
2014-11-30 08:58:02	Sirisian	hmm 25 USD

2014-11-30 08:59:32	mantis	Sirisian: pretty much all 3D printing I've done so far was out of ABS :P
2014-11-30 08:59:45	mantis	what's the nozzle size on this?
2014-11-30 08:59:51	Sirisian	very tiny
2014-11-30 09:00:09	mantis	'very tiny' is not a metric value
2014-11-30 09:00:33	Sirisian	.40mm
2014-11-30 09:00:36	Sirisian	>_>
2014-11-30 09:00:42	mantis	so, it's standard, on the wider end

2014-11-30 09:02:03	Sirisian	same as the replicator 2
2014-11-30 09:03:19	mantis	like I said, standard
2014-11-30 09:03:31	mantis	when you said 'very tiny', I hoped for >= .2mm
2014-11-30 09:03:35	Sargon	mantis: Your next project should be a full food replicator and you should send it for me as a beta site
2014-11-30 09:03:46	Sirisian	This is my favorite 3d printer by the way: https://www.ultimaker.com/ It's very expensive though. 0.4 mm nozel also.
2014-11-30 09:03:58	mantis	nozzle :P
2014-11-30 09:03:58	Sirisian	I saw that one in person and it has basically flawless prints.
2014-11-30 09:04:51	Sirisian	also 20 micron resolution. :P
2014-11-30 09:05:31	mantis	well, I've seen in person (and used) lulzbot, reprap, and whatever else
2014-11-30 09:06:40	mantis	we won lulzbot in some hackerspace contest
2014-11-30 09:06:47	@Gachuk	fuck me hiring php devs is hard work
2014-11-30 09:06:51	@Gachuk	PHP devs are just fucking idiots
2014-11-30 09:06:59	@Gachuk	trying to find the good ones out there is bloody impossible
2014-11-30 09:07:08	mantis	Gachuk: well, you have to convince person to sell their soul, no wonder it's hard
2014-11-30 09:07:13	mantis	:D
2014-11-30 09:07:21	Sirisian	Kind of waiting for 10 micron one. DARPA has serious funding right now on atomic printing. They have multiple projects they started recently to do molecular construction of parts.
2014-11-30 09:07:29	@Gachuk	we're trying to hire atm and we had a few cvs in we looked at
2014-11-30 09:07:36	@Gachuk	me and the other lead both went meh they seem pretty basic
2014-11-30 09:07:41	@Gachuk	but okay lets get them in for an interview
2014-11-30 09:07:46	@Gachuk	maybe we'll be surprised
2014-11-30 09:07:49	@Gachuk	one has sent through code samples
2014-11-30 09:07:51	@Gachuk	oh boy is it bad
2014-11-30 09:08:12	Sirisian	Gachuk, You know how you hire a PHP dev? Hire a node.js dev and give them a simple project then give them a PHP project and hope they don't complain.
2014-11-30 09:08:16	Sirisian	Done.
2014-11-30 09:08:22	Sargon	Gachuk: You obviously need to show them the office has a 3D printer... if they are really noobs then sandwiches in the cafeteria will make it seems like a luxury work place
2014-11-30 09:08:25	@Gachuk	ye but they would still be shit Sirisian 
2014-11-30 09:08:32	Sirisian	:P
2014-11-30 09:08:57	@Gachuk	I think the low barrier to entry for PHP historically unfortuantly means you get a lot of bad people

2014-11-30 09:09:30	@Gachuk	although they usually want more money too
2014-11-30 09:09:33	mantis	hell, even lulzbot is like 2k USD
2014-11-30 09:09:51	Sargon	Gachuk: What was your first PHP job?
2014-11-30 09:10:21	@Gachuk	not quite sure what you're asking?
2014-11-30 09:10:30	Sargon	Were you also writting sucky code in the past?
2014-11-30 09:10:39	@Gachuk	well you forget, I didn't learn to code from PHP
2014-11-30 09:10:41	Sargon	Sucky PHP code
2014-11-30 09:10:47	@Gachuk	I just got a job that required me to do PHP
2014-11-30 09:10:54	Sargon	lol
2014-11-30 09:11:03	Sirisian	lulzbot is only 75 micron. :\
2014-11-30 09:11:16	Sargon	You can do the same to someone "Oh, you will need to code PHP from time to time... Just sign here under Mr Satan"
2014-11-30 09:11:22	@Gachuk	heh quite
2014-11-30 09:11:37	@Gachuk	it wasnt my first job either, I just got into web dev area and then well PHP is unfortunatly a massive area in web dev
2014-11-30 09:11:40	@Gachuk	still is
2014-11-30 09:11:50	@Gachuk	doesn't mean it's a good thing, but well money etc
2014-11-30 09:12:29	Sirisian	I just hired a CS person that was rather smart. Not sure when he starts.
2014-11-30 09:12:40	Sirisian	Gachuk, do you hire people with CS degrees?
2014-11-30 09:12:45	@Gachuk	sure
2014-11-30 09:12:49	@Gachuk	but it's not a requirement
2014-11-30 09:13:15	@Gachuk	and it doesn't mean they are capable programmers either
2014-11-30 09:13:19	Sargon	You might literally ruin someone's life by hiring him to do PHP on his first job
2014-11-30 09:13:35	@Gachuk	a jobs a job

2014-11-30 09:13:50	Sargon	Yea, but the next job looks at what kind of experience you had

2014-11-30 09:14:17	@Gachuk	rather than just the php bit
2014-11-30 09:14:24	mantis	not that I have ANY free time at all, with all my projects
2014-11-30 09:14:36	@KnightTemplar	Sirisian: YOU hired someone?
2014-11-30 09:14:56	Sirisian	KnightTemplar, I'm the lead engineer at my company.
2014-11-30 09:15:04	@KnightTemplar	What do you guys make?
2014-11-30 09:15:06	Sargon	Gachuk: I don't know, I think employers will notice if most of your experience was in PHP and you suddenly try to tell them you are a C++ programmer
2014-11-30 09:15:10	Sirisian	Digital Signage software.
2014-11-30 09:15:13	@KnightTemplar	oh, good
2014-11-30 09:15:15	@Gachuk	well yes that will hinder you

2014-11-30 09:15:23	@Gachuk	as C++ job would be a different thing
2014-11-30 09:15:35	Sirisian	KnightTemplar, medical and plane guidance stuff. I have no idea. We have a lot of tickets.
2014-11-30 09:15:39	@Gachuk	but web dev jobs with different skillsets meh
2014-11-30 09:15:42	@Gachuk	and you might be able to move sideways
2014-11-30 09:15:50	Sargon	Sirisian: Don't you work for code_zombie?
2014-11-30 09:15:52	@Gachuk	my experience is not just PHP despite what everyone here likes to think
2014-11-30 09:16:04	Sirisian	Sargon, he left a while ago.
2014-11-30 09:16:11	@Gachuk	and as for my current job it's a fraction of what I do
2014-11-30 09:16:13	Sargon	I know, didn't you leave with him?
2014-11-30 09:16:24	Sirisian	no? I love my job.
2014-11-30 09:16:28	Sargon	Ahh ok
2014-11-30 09:16:36	Sargon	But he got you there in the first place, right?
2014-11-30 09:16:39	Sirisian	yep
2014-11-30 09:16:58	Sargon	Nice
2014-11-30 09:17:30	Sirisian	Yeah. Turnover in software is fast. purebre is new also remember. We have 2 previous people that were let go or left also.
2014-11-30 09:17:43	Sargon	Well this thing says I am using 1.7 GB of memory on my Android app, shall I believe my counter? XD
2014-11-30 09:18:22	Sargon	It crashed but log cat didn't say anything about memory but it might be because OpenGL memory issues is more brutal, not sure
2014-11-30 09:18:43	Sargon	In any case, the texture counter suggest I don't release textures :/
2014-11-30 09:18:55	Sirisian	Part of me kind of wants to buy a 3d printer. The other part of me realizes it would be a huge waste of time.
2014-11-30 09:19:26	Sargon	Sirisian: A good thing is to make a list of all the things you want to print before buying a printer
2014-11-30 09:19:36	Sargon	If the list is big enough to justify a printer, maybe you should
2014-11-30 09:19:36	Sirisian	I have.
2014-11-30 09:19:48	Sargon	You can't order the printing elsewhere?
2014-11-30 09:19:55	Sirisian	Well the things I want to print basically require building a whole hobby around it.
2014-11-30 09:20:01	Sirisian	Even if I did print it elsewhere.
2014-11-30 09:20:08	Sargon	Ahh
2014-11-30 09:20:13	Sargon	You can't print time XD
2014-11-30 09:20:17	Sirisian	like what mantis is doing. Going back to electronics.

2014-11-30 13:17:29	DeM0nFiRe	Do you just sign into the same account on both?
2014-11-30 13:17:34	@Gachuk	yep
2014-11-30 13:17:37	@Gachuk	they allow it
2014-11-30 13:17:37	DeM0nFiRe	Huh, wow
2014-11-30 13:17:47	@Gachuk	it's supposedly because if I travel to the US
2014-11-30 13:17:52	@Gachuk	then i can get netflix still
2014-11-30 13:17:56	@Gachuk	but ye herp derp proxy

2014-11-30 13:19:07	DeM0nFiRe	'cause like, if they see someone who's in the US, then in the UK, and then a couple hours later back in the US again, they can probably figure out that person isn't actually travelling :P

2014-11-30 14:01:27	Roy_Fokker	ace4016, yes
2014-11-30 14:02:00	Roy_Fokker	are you not able to pitch?
2014-11-30 14:02:35	Roy_Fokker	check the deadzone setting in-game options
2014-11-30 14:02:56	Roy_Fokker	it also has assignments of how yaw, pitch and roll is setup
2014-11-30 14:03:07	ace4016	i can set yaw, pitch, and roll to any axis, but find both configurations of yaw/pitch or roll/pitch on the stick a little funky with the way the game behaves
2014-11-30 14:03:45	Roy_Fokker	is this Freespace 2 retail, or Freespace 2 Open?

2014-11-30 14:04:25	ace4016	with pitch/roll on the stick, it feels like i'm the only one rolling and keeping my target in the crosshairs is difficult; pitch/yaw feels like i'm using a mouse joytstick
2014-11-30 14:04:36	ace4016	retail
2014-11-30 14:04:49	Roy_Fokker	try FSO
2014-11-30 14:04:56	Roy_Fokker	it installs on top of retail
2014-11-30 14:05:59	Roy_Fokker	in fS2 you don't really need yaw
2014-11-30 14:06:07	Roy_Fokker	i recall playing mostly with pitch and roll
2014-11-30 14:06:20	Roy_Fokker	perhaps, i am mis-remembering 
2014-11-30 14:06:33	Roy_Fokker	also i only play with Twisty stick
2014-11-30 14:06:41	Roy_Fokker	so i could be inadvertantly yawing

2014-11-30 14:07:31	ace4016	Roy_Fokker, what's the advantage of FSO?
2014-11-30 14:07:39	Roy_Fokker	visually it's better
2014-11-30 14:07:43	Roy_Fokker	bunch of bug fixes
2014-11-30 14:08:00	Roy_Fokker	higher resolution support

2014-11-30 14:29:23	Rotaerk	hmm sounds okay I guess; not ideal

2014-11-30 14:31:21	Shadowdancer	Rotaerk: you just described pre-trammel UO, and it was a shithole
2014-11-30 14:31:37	@Gachuk	 PvP can work, but only in small communitys
2014-11-30 14:31:40	@Gachuk	most mmos are far too vast
2014-11-30 14:31:42	Rotaerk	Shadowdancer, why?
2014-11-30 14:31:43	@Gachuk	so you just get dicks
2014-11-30 14:31:45	@Gachuk	constant dicks
2014-11-30 14:31:51	@Gachuk	everywhere
2014-11-30 14:31:55	@zao	Dicks-as-a-Service
2014-11-30 14:32:12	@Gachuk	best UO pvp experience i had was on a small community server, so I think total playerbase was 200

2014-11-30 14:32:15	Shadowdancer	that's why

2014-11-30 14:32:24	ace4016	dicks everywhere?
2014-11-30 14:32:28	Shadowdancer	not literal dicks
2014-11-30 14:32:30	@Gachuk	different kind of dicks

2014-11-30 14:33:14	@Gachuk	also SL went all non adult I think
2014-11-30 14:33:17	Rotaerk	Shadowdancer, so the "problem" with the idea of PVP everywhere, with enforced consequences in some places, is bad because of asshole griefers?
2014-11-30 14:33:24	 *	Shadowdancer makes a language jokes about dick literals and long/double dicks
2014-11-30 14:33:33	Shadowdancer	yes
2014-11-30 14:33:46	@Gachuk	yes Rotaerk, because you can not control the arseholes in the slightest
2014-11-30 14:33:51	Shadowdancer	you can't create a social system ignoring the nature of players you'll be attracting
2014-11-30 14:34:03	Rotaerk	hmm I don't see why such a system depends on them not being assholes
2014-11-30 14:34:08	Shadowdancer	and if you open up a gateway for dicks, then dicks is what you'll have
2014-11-30 14:34:22	@Gachuk	perhaps if there was serious consequences for being a dick
2014-11-30 14:34:26	@Gachuk	but that's hard in a game
2014-11-30 14:34:33	@Gachuk	because well it doesnt really have consequences
2014-11-30 14:34:39	Rotaerk	well yes, being a dick should be allowed, and accounted for
2014-11-30 14:34:54	Rotaerk	but you can impose consequences that would actually matter to the player
2014-11-30 14:34:58	ace4016	Rotaerk wants to open up the flood gates: http://www.awesomelyluvvie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hot-dogs-face.gif
2014-11-30 14:35:07	@Gachuk	as I said small community where you can control the society a little better perhaps, massive mmos for entire armys of dicks
2014-11-30 14:35:10	@Gachuk	no thanks
2014-11-30 14:35:14	Rotaerk	ace4016, lol

2014-11-30 14:36:05	Rotaerk	yea, I don't like PVP that involves a large blob of players overwhelming everything
2014-11-30 14:36:12	Shadowdancer	so basically you eitehr do what eve did, tell decent human beings that this isn't aplace for them and roll with it, or you try to make a fun game with... rules 'n shit
2014-11-30 14:36:16	Shadowdancer	and opt-outs
2014-11-30 14:36:33	Shadowdancer	"[X] I don't want to play with dickwads"  problem solved
2014-11-30 14:36:58	@Gachuk	my experience has generally been consentual pvp is more fun
2014-11-30 14:37:01	@Gachuk	you know what you're getting into
2014-11-30 14:37:13	Rotaerk	one thing I don't like is games that give you too little power to deal with dickwads
2014-11-30 14:37:17	Shadowdancer	of course the dickwads will complain because you're restricting them living out their power fantasies
2014-11-30 14:37:20	Rotaerk	because even without combat, they can still fuck with you
2014-11-30 14:37:24	Shadowdancer	oh dear will they EVER be up in arms
2014-11-30 14:37:43	Rotaerk	in archeage, people fuck with me by, say, pushing me around while I'm trying to use the auction house
2014-11-30 14:37:50	@Gachuk	oh man I hate that
2014-11-30 14:37:53	Rotaerk	but the game offers me no means of retaliation
2014-11-30 14:38:00	@Gachuk	i've been playing archeage and my server 2 known guilds are utter dicks
2014-11-30 14:38:05	@Gachuk	their entire purpose is to be a dick
2014-11-30 14:38:11	DeM0nFiRe	Shadowdancer: eve doesn't tell decent human beings it isn't a place for them, it tells everyone that they actually have to make a choice
2014-11-30 14:38:45	Shadowdancer	what was the game where they made vendors really huge because they were blocked by dickwads with HUGE bodytype characters 24/7?
2014-11-30 14:39:06	Rotaerk	hahah
2014-11-30 14:39:08	@Gachuk	lol really?
2014-11-30 14:39:11	Rotaerk	that's awesome
2014-11-30 14:39:14	@Gachuk	I dont remember hearing that story
2014-11-30 14:39:31	Shadowdancer	DeM0nFiRe: that "choice" is basically "so you eitehr grind those 3 ever-repeating missions over and over, and then some over again, or you get raped by the dickwolves"
2014-11-30 14:39:44	Rotaerk	"Because exposition, the only race capable of being merchants are ogres!"
2014-11-30 14:40:19	@zao	Reminds me of ever trying to move in cities in Lineage II.
2014-11-30 14:40:31	@zao	Which had player collision, and you sold shit by AFKing sitting.
2014-11-30 14:40:38	@Gachuk	you know, a pve mmo space game could be a lot of fun
2014-11-30 14:40:43	DeM0nFiRe	Shadowdancer: What? No it isn't, the choice is "Do I bring out a super expensive ship to do what I want to do, or do I bring down the price by 70% and sacrifice 15% efficiency"
2014-11-30 14:41:31	@Gachuk	also speaking of archeage, that annoys me about the pvp, okay faction vs faction fine... maybe open water fine... but when I have to worry about my own god damn faction from being constant dicks
2014-11-30 14:41:35	@Gachuk	kinda annoys me
2014-11-30 14:41:51	DeM0nFiRe	For a while in Planetside 2, people would place turrets in all of the exist of the main base (which everyone used to start in) and play stupid shit over the mic :/
2014-11-30 14:42:42	+AndrewBC	lol archeage
2014-11-30 14:42:51	Rotaerk	Gachuk, I don't mind the fact that my own faction can be dicks; I just wish the game gave me the means to get back at them
2014-11-30 14:43:05	+AndrewBC	that game is owned by bots, like most other south korean mmos
2014-11-30 14:43:08	@Gachuk	meh, i think it just encourages very little co-op
2014-11-30 14:43:11	@Gachuk	AndrewBC: sadly yes
2014-11-30 14:43:32	@Gachuk	it has some nice qualities though
2014-11-30 14:43:33	@Gachuk	which is a shame
2014-11-30 14:43:50	@Gachuk	Rotaerk: I'd personally prefer if it was just faction vs faction
2014-11-30 14:43:55	+AndrewBC	south korea doesn't have that problem because ever citizen has an id and the game has that id
2014-11-30 14:44:09	Rotaerk	Gachuk, in my ideal MMO, there wouldn't be any hard-coded factions
2014-11-30 14:44:13	+AndrewBC	so mmos coded there do shit all security
2014-11-30 14:44:25	@Gachuk	if you dont have hard coded factions you just have open world pvp
2014-11-30 14:44:26	@Gachuk	with guilds
2014-11-30 14:44:32	@Gachuk	so yay griefers
2014-11-30 14:44:42	Rotaerk	there could be de-facto factions, but no game rules that enforce you abide by them
2014-11-30 14:44:47	%mantis	If I'll need you I'll give a little whistle that suddenly chokes into silence
2014-11-30 14:44:50	@Gachuk	at least with enforced factions you have an element of co-op
2014-11-30 14:44:50	%mantis	heh
2014-11-30 14:44:54	Rotaerk	though I guess my ideal MMO depends too much on people roleplaying
2014-11-30 14:45:00	@Gachuk	quite
2014-11-30 14:45:03	@Gachuk	I love the IDEA
2014-11-30 14:45:13	@Gachuk	but it's just not going to work in practice, at least not large scale
2014-11-30 14:45:19	@Gachuk	as I said, if you have small scale mmos
2014-11-30 14:45:20	+AndrewBC	archage being licensed to trion worlds is shittier than someone trying their best to fix it, trion just wants money
2014-11-30 14:45:21	@Gachuk	more like muds of old
2014-11-30 14:45:23	@Gachuk	with small communitys
2014-11-30 14:45:25	@Gachuk	that is much more doable
2014-11-30 14:45:32	Rotaerk	yea the Iron Realms MUDs are what inspire me
2014-11-30 14:45:32	@Gachuk	especially if you give them the ability to self regulate
2014-11-30 14:45:39	Rotaerk	the people in them actually roleplay
2014-11-30 14:45:41	@Gachuk	or at least hell active gms
2014-11-30 14:45:50	%mantis	Rotaerk: and possibility to engage in matrimonial ceremony with gamma radiation created mutants?
2014-11-30 14:46:03	+AndrewBC	taking a nap
2014-11-30 14:46:04	@Gachuk	I mean going back to muds, a lot I used to play you could achieve immortality through quest lines (basically GM) and then you were part of the community
2014-11-30 14:46:25	Rotaerk	mantis, of course, duh!
2014-11-30 14:46:43	Rotaerk	I wanna marry the Hulk, and have man-babbies
2014-11-30 14:46:46	@Gachuk	MMOs with thousands of people are just a haven for dicks, who have no desire to be part of any community
2014-11-30 14:47:06	Rotaerk	I still think that dicks can be dealt with somehow
2014-11-30 14:47:11	@Gachuk	I don't
2014-11-30 14:47:25	@Gachuk	unless you can fundamentally change human nature
2014-11-30 14:47:33	@Gachuk	because news flash, humans suck
2014-11-30 14:47:58	@Gachuk	and they're even worse when they are "anonymous"
2014-11-30 14:48:13	Rotaerk	I don't mean prevent them from being dicks, or pretend that they aren't, so much as somehow give them practical consequences that severely discourage it
2014-11-30 14:48:24	Rotaerk	ultimately make them not *fun* for them
2014-11-30 14:48:29	@zao	Gachuk: Ended up on the dickwad theory when loading random comics on PA the other day.
2014-11-30 14:48:43	@Gachuk	unless it costs them money or possibly physically harms them in RL
2014-11-30 14:48:47	@zao	http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/
2014-11-30 14:48:55	@Gachuk	zao: Shadowdancer just pasted this:P

2014-11-30 14:49:23	@Gachuk	yes I'm ranting!
2014-11-30 14:49:26	Rotaerk	I think it *can* cost them money... basically make it so at the very least your account itself is penalized for certain crimes, and that to get a new one costs money
2014-11-30 14:49:46	@zao	Rotaerk: So now only people with disposable money can be wankers.
2014-11-30 14:49:49	%mantis	Gachuk: LIGHTZWEIHANDER!
2014-11-30 14:49:50	@Gachuk	even then it doesn't really stop a lot of problems
2014-11-30 14:50:01	Rotaerk	zao, fewer of them at least !
2014-11-30 14:50:04	@Gachuk	because some do have a lot of money and can be dicks with it, or botters
2014-11-30 14:50:11	Rotaerk	a lot of them are young people anyway
2014-11-30 14:50:23	@Gachuk	I'm all for banning kids from the internet >_>
2014-11-30 14:50:34	@Gachuk	under 21 gtfo
2014-11-30 14:50:42	@Gachuk	have the maturity of somebody under 21, gtfo
2014-11-30 14:51:01	@Gachuk	so that is basically the majority of the population >_>
2014-11-30 14:51:02	Rotaerk	one thing you could do is... each account can have only 1 character.  deleting that character takes days, and the character itself can be stuck in jail for days of real time
2014-11-30 14:51:11	Rotaerk	so that the only way around it is to buy a new account
2014-11-30 14:51:32	Rotaerk	in most MMOs, if you're a dick, the worst someone can do to you is kill you ...
2014-11-30 14:51:37	Rotaerk	you wake up in the graveyard and repeat
2014-11-30 14:51:52	Rotaerk	death having no consequence is also a part of the problem
2014-11-30 14:53:09	@MikeP	yeah, we should be able to kill them for real!

2014-11-30 15:00:13	Rotaerk	if someone slid a light saber down the length of that thing, it wouldn't hit the crossguard's light beam
2014-11-30 15:00:18	@zao	Rotaerk: Trolling the internet.

2014-11-30 15:08:17	%mantis	you really want to do that
2014-11-30 15:08:43	%mantis	it's probably one of the best take on The Force I've seen
2014-11-30 15:08:57	%mantis	and it's really REALLY meta
2014-11-30 15:09:12	%mantis	you'd probably enjoy it

2014-11-30 15:11:26	%mantis	pick it up
2014-11-30 15:11:33	%mantis	it's well worth the money

2014-11-30 17:20:24	%Rawr	I seem to have gotten some books from amazon
2014-11-30 17:20:27	%Rawr	when did I order these books
2014-11-30 17:20:40	Mushu	Rawr: I would assume they're backlogged, given black friday
2014-11-30 17:20:54	%Rawr	Looks like I ordered them on wendsday
2014-11-30 17:20:56	%Rawr	I don't remember this
2014-11-30 17:20:56	Mushu	'Tis the season for late deliveries

2014-11-30 17:21:10	%Rawr	Thank you, past rawr!
2014-11-30 17:21:14	@zao	Mushu: I'm in a "let's try a hyped language" mood.
2014-11-30 17:21:18	Mushu	What book did you order?
2014-11-30 17:21:26	%Rawr	Mushu: DnD 5th edition players handbook
2014-11-30 17:21:27	%Rawr	apparently
2014-11-30 17:21:28	Mushu	zao: hmmm, how about Go?
2014-11-30 17:21:34	%Rawr	zao: Rust!
2014-11-30 17:21:36	Mushu	Rawr: there's a 5th edition now?
2014-11-30 17:21:36	@zao	For TCP + HTTP serving, I'm thinking either Go or Racket.
2014-11-30 17:21:43	%Rawr	Mushu: yeah, its actually pretty cool
2014-11-30 17:21:46	%Rawr	its like a streamlined 3.5
2014-11-30 17:21:46	Mushu	ooh, Racket, that's a more esoteric choice
2014-11-30 17:21:53	Mushu	Rawr: oh thank goodness
2014-11-30 17:21:54	@zao	Rawr: Undid a bunch of v4 damage?

2014-11-30 17:22:09	@zao	Rawr: Not sure how Rust fares in that domain.
2014-11-30 17:22:15	%Rawr	its mostly just ... simpler 3.5
2014-11-30 17:22:26	%Rawr	and casters aren't the only viable choice anymore, it looks like (?)
2014-11-30 17:22:37	Mushu	lol
2014-11-30 17:22:47	%Rawr	And now instead of feats
2014-11-30 17:22:56	%Rawr	you get a feat or the ability to get +2 to stats

2014-11-30 17:23:20	@zao	Rawr: So mostly mattering for PnP DnD, where 4E was CPRG-on-paper?
2014-11-30 17:23:28	%Rawr	Yeah, looks like
2014-11-30 17:23:42	%Rawr	Also you don't prepare spells in given spell slots anymore - you just have a bunch of spell slots and spells
2014-11-30 17:23:47	%Rawr	and you can choose what spell slot to use to cast a spell
2014-11-30 17:23:56	Mushu	so everyone's a sorceror now.

2014-11-30 17:28:49	%Rawr	so its mostly automagic
2014-11-30 17:28:58	@zao	Rawr: Going to need proper TCP too.

2014-11-30 17:35:36	%mantis	so, first I represent the number in base 4, and then iterate over the number and translate it to A, C, G and T
2014-11-30 17:36:40	@zao	"represent the number in base 4"?
2014-11-30 17:36:58	@zao	I hope that you're not stringifying it in base 4.
2014-11-30 17:38:04	@zao	Could be done with a linear scan through pairs of bits.
2014-11-30 17:38:46	@zao	You're going to have a bit of a hard time if the one corresponding to 0 is in the MSD of the number.
2014-11-30 17:39:02	%mantis	zao: i have no idea what you mean by 'stringifying', but my assignment is: order k-mers alphabetically and assign numbers to them
2014-11-30 17:39:07	%mantis	and the other way around
2014-11-30 17:39:31	%mantis	where k-mer is string of ACGTAGAGCACCATTA of length k
2014-11-30 17:40:09	@zao	mantis: Without k, you cannot tell where in your number the base occurs.
2014-11-30 17:40:12	%mantis	I assigned number to polymers, now I need a lookup function for (value, k)

2014-11-30 17:40:48	%mantis	or I have a value and k, and need to convert it to k-mer
2014-11-30 17:41:00	%mantis	for a given value and given k, there is only one k-mer
2014-11-30 17:41:13	%mantis	sure, AAA and A both have value of 0
2014-11-30 17:41:21	%mantis	but AAA has k of 3, and A has k of 1

2014-11-30 17:42:38	%mantis	also, I never thought about approaching searching array for k-mers using frequency array
2014-11-30 17:42:47	%mantis	that really accelerates my algorithms

2014-11-30 17:52:08	@MikeP	64k max per frame
2014-11-30 17:52:13	%Rawr	MikeP: x2 for two frames
2014-11-30 17:52:21	@MikeP	it's a #define, you can change it to be whatever you want
2014-11-30 17:52:29	%Rawr	I just feel like he could like
2014-11-30 17:52:32	%mantis	you mean it would be faster to just check binary?
2014-11-30 17:52:36	%Rawr	dynamically allocate that
2014-11-30 17:52:48	%Rawr	but I guess then you would have to allocate during render command generation
2014-11-30 17:52:58	@MikeP	yeah, it's a multithreaded renderer
2014-11-30 17:53:00	@zao	mantis: If you're taking numbers out from the bottom, it doesn't matter much.
2014-11-30 17:53:12	@MikeP	keeping the interaction points simple is a big win
2014-11-30 17:53:23	@zao	mantis: Point is that you can scan the number from the top and just mask out parts of it.
2014-11-30 17:53:43	@MikeP	you could probably define it as 4k draw calls and have no issue, 64k is pretty big
2014-11-30 17:53:49	%Rawr	Yeah 
2014-11-30 17:54:00	%Rawr	I'm also kinda ambivilent about the global access to renderer state

2014-11-30 18:01:40	@zao	/=4 and >>2 are equivalent in perf, as a Good Compiler rewrites it to the proper one.
2014-11-30 18:01:53	@zao	The point is, you must work from the bottom of the number if you use / and %.
2014-11-30 18:02:16	%mantis	well, just rotate it at the return end
2014-11-30 18:02:17	@zao	If your number is expressible in a whole number of bits, you can take arbitrary bites out of the number.

2014-11-30 18:02:49	@zao	Thought you were looking for a good solution.
2014-11-30 18:03:14	@zao	In particular, your solution requires intermediary storage.
2014-11-30 18:03:18	%mantis	zao: well, ok, I am. but I'm iterating over the number anyways, to convert to ACGT
2014-11-30 18:03:22	@zao	While an algorithm that can decode in order can stream it out.
2014-11-30 18:03:43	%mantis	so instead of s += c I do so.insertatbegin(c)
2014-11-30 18:04:07	@zao	mantis: What overhead does your cheap-insert-at-front data structure have?
2014-11-30 18:04:22	%mantis	dunno. C# string standard?
2014-11-30 18:04:37	@zao	And again, requires intermediary storage, as you cannot produce the first glyph until the whole k-mer is processed.

2014-11-30 18:10:08	@zao	That's equivalent to extracting the bottom two bits of the number, and shifting two bits to the right.

2014-11-30 18:10:48	@zao	Thing with masking out bits is that you can do it at any even group of bits in the number.
2014-11-30 18:10:58	@zao	You still do the same work, but you do it from the top of the number.

2014-11-30 18:13:22	%mantis	not some magical function that I'm not aware of?
2014-11-30 18:13:28	@zao	Or shift the number down, mask with 3.
2014-11-30 18:13:33	@zao	mantis: Regular boring bit operations.
2014-11-30 18:14:04	@zao	You could do it with divisions and modulo too, but it'd be more expensive.
2014-11-30 18:14:42	@zao	So divide your number so that only the thing you care about is in the LSD, and then modulo.
2014-11-30 18:15:09	@zao	It kind of depends on what kinds of operations you've got on your bignum, and how expensive they are.
2014-11-30 18:15:59	@zao	Division works for other bases than the ones that are powers of two, but carries a lack of optimizability on the ones that are.

2014-11-30 18:18:36	%mantis	the question now is: how do I figure out what's the highest power of four in a number
2014-11-30 18:18:45	%mantis	so that I can bitshift from top
2014-11-30 18:19:07	@zao	If you've got k pairs of bits, how many bits do you have? :)
2014-11-30 18:19:32	%mantis	zao: let me rephrase my question: how do I figure out how many bits are in a number
2014-11-30 18:19:47	@zao	That's determined by the type.
2014-11-30 18:20:01	@zao	Or in a bignum, the index of the highest non-zero bit.
2014-11-30 18:20:21	@zao	What number type _do_ you use?
2014-11-30 18:20:25	%mantis	int
2014-11-30 18:20:30	 *	mantis shrugs
2014-11-30 18:20:32	@zao	So 32-bit signed dongbat.
2014-11-30 18:20:47	@zao	You can store almost sixteen bases in one.

2014-11-30 22:54:27	Sirisian	So you say, but adding a camera or something complicates it. I'm sure there's some gotchas.
2014-11-30 22:55:13	ace4016	not really
2014-11-30 22:55:19	Vaayu	Sirisian: nothing complicated about adding a camera
2014-11-30 22:55:35	ace4016	Vaayu, but why else do people charge so much money!
2014-11-30 22:56:16	Vaayu	ace4016: what /is/ interesting is trying to make them silent
2014-11-30 22:56:19	Sirisian	ace4016, was talking to mantis yesterday about 3d printers. q3d printer (really good 3d printer company) released a new printer called the revolution with 25 micron layers for 1,300 USD. http://q3dprinter.com/
2014-11-30 22:56:55	ace4016	Vaayu, aye, but that's partly an aerospace engineering problem (i know a few designs to make helicopter blades a lot more silent)
2014-11-30 22:57:07	Sirisian	apparently a year old though I guess.
2014-11-30 22:57:10	Vaayu	fancy secret designs eh :O
2014-11-30 22:57:17	ace4016	adding more blades per rotor/prop helps; making them scimitar shaped also helps
2014-11-30 22:57:50	ace4016	i believe ducting them can also decrease noise
2014-11-30 22:57:57	Vaayu	also, one single motor instead of four
2014-11-30 22:58:06	Vaayu	that's where it gets really fun
2014-11-30 22:58:12	ace4016	yea
2014-11-30 22:58:31	ace4016	would require a more complex gear system
2014-11-30 22:58:45	ace4016	but if you can create it lighter than an entire motor or so, you'll have a winner

2014-11-30 23:00:57	Sirisian	Even the cheap toy copters with gears though have really fine teeth. I've always been hesitent about 3d printers making them. Like 10 microns should be bind though but the x,y has to be really precise.

2014-11-30 23:14:08	@zao	(insert right term for Hackage here)
2014-11-30 23:14:17	Mushu	zao: uhhh, what
2014-11-30 23:14:26	Mushu	I would not use distro repos
2014-11-30 23:14:47	Mushu	just install the go binaries/stdlibs, then `export GOPATH=~/go` or something, then use `go install` for the packages
2014-11-30 23:14:56	Mushu	who the fuck even knows what the distro repos are doing
2014-11-30 23:15:20	@zao	go-termbox-0.0.0.20140715
2014-11-30 23:15:21	@zao	go.net-20131227
2014-11-30 23:15:23	Mushu	realistically: the distro repos will probably do just fine and install them to $GOROOT instead of $GOPATH, but meh
2014-11-30 23:15:24	@KnightTemplar	zao: What are you building?
2014-11-30 23:15:26	@zao	*shudder*
2014-11-30 23:15:33	Mushu	zao: uhh
2014-11-30 23:15:38	@zao	KnightTemplar: Automated network cat petter.
2014-11-30 23:15:54	%Tsugumi	...
2014-11-30 23:16:00	%Tsugumi	why go/
2014-11-30 23:16:02	Mushu	zao: go.net is probably `go get code.goog.com/p/go.net`, no idea about termbox
2014-11-30 23:16:04	%Tsugumi	why not a nice sane language
2014-11-30 23:16:06	%Tsugumi	like java.
2014-11-30 23:16:08	@zao	Tsugumi: Because "not node.js"
2014-11-30 23:16:13	%Tsugumi	so
2014-11-30 23:16:14	%Tsugumi	java.
2014-11-30 23:16:19	Mushu	Tsugumi: the Go language, as terrible as it is, is better than Java
2014-11-30 23:16:25	%Tsugumi	java.
2014-11-30 23:16:28	@zao	Mushu: Just took a random sampling of 'pkg search' output, not going to need either of them in particular.
2014-11-30 23:16:29	%Tsugumi	CBasicAllocator
2014-11-30 23:16:41	Sirisian	ace4016, never realized they put this much research into nitinol http://www.nospoiler.com/y/oKmYqUSDch8 Apparently the engines only acheived like 4% energy conversion so they were scrapped.
2014-11-30 23:16:47	Mushu	zao: use `go get $package` and skip over whatever madness the package maintainers are using
2014-11-30 23:16:51	%Rawr	Mushu: lol so this lawyer is attacking this dude's credibility
2014-11-30 23:16:52	%Rawr	i guess
2014-11-30 23:17:06	Mushu	zao: since the go binaries are statically linked, there's literally no reason to do things the wrong way
2014-11-30 23:17:11	Mushu	zao: pretty much
2014-11-30 23:17:12	Mushu	err
2014-11-30 23:17:15	Mushu	Rawr: pretty much.
2014-11-30 23:17:15	@zao	Mushu: Hard to tell with things normally if packagers have gone and split shit up that shouldn't be split up, or if it's just courtesy packaging of third party stuff.
2014-11-30 23:17:29	%Rawr	zao: you also need to have your directory setup correctly
2014-11-30 23:17:31	@zao	Mushu: cf. boost-dongs-dev-1.50.0-3,4
2014-11-30 23:17:34	%Rawr	like if you have a /Development folder
2014-11-30 23:17:35	Mushu	Rawr: it's really scary that this is what happens in courtrooms
2014-11-30 23:17:36	%Rawr	you're kinda donged
2014-11-30 23:17:38	Vaayu	i actually met people who are using Go in production... they didn't look very sane...
2014-11-30 23:17:52	Mushu	zao: C++ doesn't have a built-in package management system
2014-11-30 23:18:02	@zao	Mushu: Perl, Haskell, others.
2014-11-30 23:18:15	Mushu	zao: right, and which of those are statically linked
2014-11-30 23:18:22	@zao	Haskerru, to some degree.
2014-11-30 23:18:35	Mushu	it makes sense for the built-in package system to have dependencies for dynamically linked stuff
2014-11-30 23:18:39	Mushu	but not for statically linked stuff
2014-11-30 23:18:44	@zao	Of course, cabal isn't quite first class there unless you go for The Platform.
2014-11-30 23:19:31	Mushu	zao: in any case, it'll probably just work (tm) if you install the packages from your native package system -- it'll install them into $GOROOT which can be overridden via $GOPATH
2014-11-30 23:19:44	Mushu	But realistically, go libraries tend not to break API, so it's probably not even a big deal
2014-11-30 23:19:58	@zao	So go-fuck-yourselves to the packaging, check.
2014-11-30 23:20:24	Mushu	Rawr: /Development works fine, as long as you either (A) Have /Development/Go or (B) set GOPATH for each separate project ;_;
2014-11-30 23:20:32	@zao	Setting up golang (2:1.2.1-2ubuntu1) ...
2014-11-30 23:20:40	Mushu	Rawr: I do (A) for my local dev stuff, (B) for the build systems
2014-11-30 23:20:43	@zao	Oh dear... 1.2.1 vs. 1.3.2
2014-11-30 23:20:48	@zao	Is that going to bite me in the arse?
2014-11-30 23:20:48	Mushu	such old
2014-11-30 23:20:51	Mushu	not really
2014-11-30 23:21:01	%Rawr	Mushu: urgh
2014-11-30 23:21:03	Mushu	zao: all my 1.2 stuff compiles fine under 1.3
2014-11-30 23:21:16	%Rawr	B isn't bad
2014-11-30 23:21:17	Mushu	should say "compiles and runs"
2014-11-30 23:21:32	Mushu	Rawr: yeah but then you end up with /Development/project/src/project/poop.go
2014-11-30 23:21:51	@zao	Last login: Wed Nov  5 10:24:55 CET 2014 on pts/13

2014-11-30 23:21:54	@zao	Fucking A.
2014-11-30 23:21:56	%Rawr	and you have goroot at /Development/project
2014-11-30 23:21:59	%Rawr	zao: seems legit
2014-11-30 23:22:00	Mushu	zao: port 44
2014-11-30 23:22:15	Mushu	Also disable pam and challenge-response auth
2014-11-30 23:22:17	Mushu	problem solved
2014-11-30 23:22:23	Mushu	(well, and password auth)
2014-11-30 23:22:25	@zao	Used to run Kerberos only.
2014-11-30 23:22:36	@zao	Should probably nuke passworded root.
2014-11-30 23:22:37	Mushu	legit
2014-11-30 23:22:40	Mushu	zao: lol.
2014-11-30 23:22:42	Mushu	yeah....
2014-11-30 23:22:58	Mushu	omg T-5 minutes until cyber monday EST
2014-11-30 23:23:07	Mushu	brace your wallets
2014-11-30 23:24:43	Antman-	my wallet is already in bad condition
2014-11-30 23:24:46	%Rawr	Mushu: i have nothing to buy
2014-11-30 23:24:47	%Rawr	Mushu: halp
2014-11-30 23:24:59	Mushu	Rawr: did you already upgrade your CPU?
2014-11-30 23:25:04	Mushu	not really sure why you would
2014-11-30 23:25:06	Mushu	considering sockets
2014-11-30 23:25:09	%Rawr	no because that would force me to upgrade my mobo
2014-11-30 23:25:12	Mushu	right
2014-11-30 23:25:16	Mushu	what do you need more CPU for?
2014-11-30 23:25:19	%Rawr	....
2014-11-30 23:25:19	Mushu	(in this day and age)
2014-11-30 23:25:23	%Rawr	cpu ... things
2014-11-30 23:25:30	Mushu	what are you doing that's CPU-bound?
2014-11-30 23:25:35	%Rawr	uhhh
2014-11-30 23:25:39	Mushu	>>nothing
2014-11-30 23:25:44	%Rawr	maybe compiling?
2014-11-30 23:25:48	%Rawr	unlikely, though
2014-11-30 23:25:49	Mushu	use a better language
2014-11-30 23:25:56	Mushu	problem solved, next problem please
2014-11-30 23:26:02	%Rawr	22:56 <%Rawr> Mushu: i have nothing to buy
2014-11-30 23:26:04	Mushu	Rawr: preferably one that isn't solving the halting problem
2014-11-30 23:26:09	Mushu	Rawr: buy a better GPU
2014-11-30 23:26:10	@zao	Mushu: Had Kerberos set up exactly one machine.
2014-11-30 23:26:14	Mushu	zao: lol
2014-11-30 23:26:16	%Rawr	Mushu: this seems circular
2014-11-30 23:26:18	Mushu	zao: just use RSA keys
2014-11-30 23:26:20	@zao	Which was KDC + irc shell.
2014-11-30 23:26:29	@zao	On a VPS.
2014-11-30 23:26:31	@zao	<_<
2014-11-30 23:26:35	Mushu	zao: kerberos is more for like ... AD replacement
2014-11-30 23:26:38	%Rawr	Mushu: maybe I should get 32gb of rams
2014-11-30 23:26:42	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: My old C2D wasn't good enough to run World of Tanks at any decent speed
2014-11-30 23:26:46	Mushu	Rawr: anyway, I'm buying hopefully a better GPU and 4x HDDs
2014-11-30 23:26:59	Mushu	KnightTemplar: Right, see, I expect people to be running not-decade-old hardware
2014-11-30 23:27:11	Mushu	KnightTemplar: If you've got a C2D it's time to buy a new rig
2014-11-30 23:27:12	@zao	Stopped running my own realm when I figured that it'd be a bitch to juggle principals for ZAO.SE and WORK.EXAMPLE.ORG
2014-11-30 23:27:18	@KnightTemplar	I did
2014-11-30 23:27:23	Mushu	yay!
2014-11-30 23:27:31	@zao	Mushu: I get the full horror of kerberos + ldap at work, thank you :)
2014-11-30 23:27:39	Mushu	oh fml really
2014-11-30 23:27:41	Mushu	zao: why

2014-11-30 23:29:49	@zao	Mushu: Broke as fuck, and not as prevalent over here.
2014-11-30 23:30:54	@zao	MJBrune: Several of the network drives are the same system, so there's a bit of overrepresentation.
2014-11-30 23:31:10	MJBrune	zao: yeah I assume that when they had the same maxes
2014-11-30 23:31:14	@zao	R/W, S/Z, X/Y are all paired.
2014-11-30 23:31:22	%Rawr	wait

2014-11-30 23:31:28	@zao	As for the difference in size of X and Y, I blame ZFS :)
2014-11-30 23:31:30	@zao	Rawr: IvB.
2014-11-30 23:31:37	@zao	3xxx vs. 4xxx
2014-11-30 23:31:38	Mushu	Rawr: the 4nm process one

2014-11-30 23:32:57	%Tsugumi	and tried to hang himself.

2014-11-30 23:36:26	%Tsugumi	to reinforce that feeling
2014-11-30 23:36:28	%Tsugumi	was to then reach over

2014-11-30 23:38:22	%Tsugumi	YOU NEED SATA
2014-11-30 23:38:24	@zao	Internet is unclear, seems to imply that IE will fuck up no matter what you do.

2014-12-01 01:02:33	Antman-	When using DirectWrite or FreeType with subpixel rendering, I presume you need to re-render the text every frame (or any time position changes, at least)
2014-12-01 01:02:42	Antman-	instead of caching it and redrawing from an image
2014-12-01 01:06:53	@zao	Antman-: Only if your subpixel offset changes noticeably.
2014-12-01 01:07:09	Antman-	Is there a good way to calculate that to determine if rerendering must be performed?
2014-12-01 01:07:12	@zao	You can cache multiple subpixel offsets' worth of text.
2014-12-01 01:07:29	Antman-	Wouldn't that require knowing something about the algorithm itself?
2014-12-01 01:07:32	@zao	Antman-: Simple solution is to quantize your subpixel positions yourself.
2014-12-01 01:07:43	@zao	Knobs are fun.
2014-12-01 01:07:59	Antman-	True. However, is rerendering the text every frame going to be that substantial of a hit performance-wise?
2014-12-01 01:08:06	@zao	Or you can go the wasteful way and not cache it. Or try to keep placement at whole offsets.
2014-12-01 01:08:07	Antman-	or on changes/moving/etc
2014-12-01 01:09:10	@zao	What kind of usecase do you have? 3D character nameplates? Chat text? UI elements animated?
2014-12-01 01:09:32	Antman-	UI elements (may or or may not be animated - will handle differently depending on use-case).
2014-12-01 01:09:39	Antman-	In-game rendering may happen, but that obviously would be subpixel.
2014-12-01 01:09:42	Antman-	won't*
2014-12-01 01:09:52	Antman-	would be rather hard to guarantee that.
2014-12-01 01:09:53	-->	cooky (cooky@AN-3EE5CF57.unity-media.net) has joined #gamedev
2014-12-01 01:10:29	Antman-	My original thinking was for UI, to rerender when the text changes or moves in some fashion, otherwise cache it.
2014-12-01 01:11:32	Sirisian	rendering to whole pixels is probably ideal. Then moving it isn't an issue if you render to separate targets. There are other tricks using pre-multiplied alpha if you're caching whole UI areas.
2014-12-01 01:12:02	@zao	Antman-: I can't really answer the perf concerns, but my gut feel is: "it may hurt"
2014-12-01 01:12:19	Antman-	Well, I'm more than happy to sacrifice performance for quality and flexibility so long as it isn't too expensive (can another core be used, etc)
2014-12-01 01:12:50	Antman-	I've never benchmarked it, so I don't have any statistics myself, other than an old app I wrote like 10 years ago that rerendered in OpenGL (which wasn't particularly slow - text wasn't the slowdown there)
2014-12-01 01:13:30	@zao	Note that depending on the font and hinting, subpixel positioning may not be desirable, look-wise.
2014-12-01 01:13:46	@zao	Can end up with a bit of a "crawly" feel as hinters love their pixel grids.
2014-12-01 01:14:25	Antman-	I can always add an option to disable the feature.
2014-12-01 01:14:27	@zao	That is, you want subpixel rendering inside the string, but have it anchored on a whole pixel boundary.
2014-12-01 01:14:34	Antman-	or that.
2014-12-01 01:14:38	Antman-	I just want to maximize flexibility is all.
2014-12-01 01:18:46	Sirisian	"Bug 345. I can't drag windows to half pixels. Plz fix."
2014-12-01 01:19:39	Antman-	problem is it's difficult to have a UI positioning system that is resolution agnostic
2014-12-01 01:19:52	Antman-	if you use integers, you have to have a valid range that is one-size-fits-all (or three-sizes or whatever)
2014-12-01 01:20:09	Antman-	if you use floats, you may end up with half-pixels (I suppose you could always round the result)
2014-12-01 01:20:12	Sirisian	Doing anything resolution agnostic requires a lot of work and usually SVG. (See scaleform).

2014-12-01 01:24:14	Antman-	Issue you get there is if the positions are derived from arithmetic, where floating point inaccuracies can lead to 0.4_9 and 0.50_1

2014-12-01 01:38:53	Antman-	Why do you need a special title to be in game development?
2014-12-01 01:38:58	Antman-	My title is quite literally 'Programmer'
2014-12-01 01:39:08	Antman-	internally I refer to myself as a senior software engineer
2014-12-01 01:39:21	MJBrune	Programmer seems like a bad title
2014-12-01 01:39:25	Antman-	but that's because I have seniority over a significant number of other programmers
2014-12-01 01:40:23	MJBrune	Well here is another company (not the one I work for) that uses 3D game developer as a title https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/18364102
2014-12-01 01:40:35	-->	cooky (cooky@AN-3EE5CF57.unity-media.net) has joined #gamedev
2014-12-01 01:41:02	Antman-	They're welcome to use the title. It still sounds silly.
2014-12-01 01:41:24	Antman-	Though I wouldn't say Objective C is a particularly high-level programming language.
2014-12-01 01:41:32	Antman-	It's a low level one with very weird high-level capabilities.
2014-12-01 01:41:46	Antman-	Certainly not on the level of Java (or Javascript, as they also list).
2014-12-01 01:41:46	MJBrune	never used it before
2014-12-01 01:42:08	MJBrune	but I know of several people who would say its very high level compared to C or such
2014-12-01 01:42:19	MJBrune	but those are driver devs
2014-12-01 01:42:29	Antman-	Objective C is a superset of C.
2014-12-01 01:42:38	MJBrune	yes much like C++
2014-12-01 01:42:49	Antman-	It certainly has higher level capabilities, just like C++. It, however, is not a high-level language functionally.
2014-12-01 01:42:52	Antman-	Not like C# or Java.
2014-12-01 01:42:52	MJBrune	But they would call C++ higher level
2014-12-01 01:43:02	Antman-	C++ has the same capabilities as C does, so I'd call them wrong.
2014-12-01 01:43:12	Antman-	I've also done kernel development, and have exclusively used assembly and C++.
2014-12-01 01:43:12	wartech0	C++ is a moderately high level language
2014-12-01 01:43:14	MJBrune	actually it doesn't
2014-12-01 01:43:20	wartech0	just a couple steps above C
2014-12-01 01:43:23	Antman-	MJBrune - name one thing that C++ cannot do that C can.
2014-12-01 01:43:27	Antman-	Just one.
2014-12-01 01:43:35	wartech0	Antman-, OO
2014-12-01 01:43:38	 *	wartech0 snickers
2014-12-01 01:43:41	MJBrune	Antman-: there are several things that C moved on to doing.
2014-12-01 01:43:45	Antman-	wartech0 - C can do OO?
2014-12-01 01:43:49	Antman-	without define nests/includes?
2014-12-01 01:43:59	Antman-	:D
2014-12-01 01:44:01	wartech0	Antman-, well you can
2014-12-01 01:44:03	wartech0	but its hacky
2014-12-01 01:44:09	Antman-	yes, usually define nests or include nests
2014-12-01 01:44:12	Antman-	which are awful
2014-12-01 01:44:17	Antman-	and basically emulate vtables anyways
2014-12-01 01:44:34	MJBrune	Example Antman-: int foo = Something(); int array[ foo ];  // C++ can't do this, but C can IIRC 
2014-12-01 01:44:42	Antman-	Which is benefitial how?
2014-12-01 01:44:47	Antman-	beneficial
2014-12-01 01:44:52	MJBrune	doesn't matter if it's beneficial
2014-12-01 01:44:54	Antman-	that's not a feature, that's a language/syntax quirk.
2014-12-01 01:45:05	Antman-	In that case, the ability to implicitly cast pointers is something 'different'.
2014-12-01 01:45:07	MJBrune	Just saying its not a straight superset
2014-12-01 01:45:19	Antman-	Of course not, but C++ is equally capable as C in the same realm, which is why it was made the way it is
2014-12-01 01:45:35	Antman-	They exist on the same 'level', but C++ stretches higher.
2014-12-01 01:45:46	wartech0	both are fairly low level
2014-12-01 01:46:05	Antman-	wartech0 - if we gave languages a 'range' that constituted their 'levelness', C and C++ would have the same bottom.
2014-12-01 01:46:07	MJBrune	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3879636/what-can-be-done-in-c-but-not-c
2014-12-01 01:46:09	Antman-	C++ would go further up.
2014-12-01 01:46:10	%Tsugumi	variable length arrays, in C, are a terrible idea
2014-12-01 01:46:28	MJBrune	http://david.tribble.com/text/cdiffs.htm
2014-12-01 01:46:37	Antman-	Not to mention you could use variable length arrays in C++, just not built into the language
2014-12-01 01:46:38	%Tsugumi	it's just another example of the C standrards committee being decades behind common sense.
2014-12-01 01:46:39	Antman-	*cough* alloca
2014-12-01 01:46:47	<--	mtsr (mtsr@AN-F0DA5C55.cm-11-1b.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has quit (Quit)
2014-12-01 01:46:50	MJBrune	there are a few things C can do that C++ can't. Not saying they are good things but I am saying they are things.
2014-12-01 01:47:11	wartech0	I don't mind C or C++
2014-12-01 01:47:13	wartech0	I can use both
2014-12-01 01:47:18	Antman-	MJBrune - How about this - there's nothing _functionally_ that C can do that C++ cannot.
2014-12-01 01:47:19	wartech0	I prefer to use C++ though
2014-12-01 01:47:29	Antman-	C has some syntax sugar that's not in C++, and C++ has a lot that's not in C.
2014-12-01 01:47:42	Antman-	They are both equally capable of representing the same programs, unlike higher-level languages.
2014-12-01 01:47:50	MJBrune	Antman-: eh thats like saying python, perl and even java can do everything that C/C++ can do.
2014-12-01 01:47:55	MJBrune	its just different syntax
2014-12-01 01:47:55	Antman-	No, they can't.
2014-12-01 01:47:58	Antman-	None of them have pointer arithmetic.
2014-12-01 01:48:12	MJBrune	eh I guess that is true
2014-12-01 01:48:14	Antman-	Java can 'kind of' do it.
2014-12-01 01:48:17	Antman-	Not in a nice way.
2014-12-01 01:48:37	wartech0	I see it more as a family based thing
2014-12-01 01:48:48	MJBrune	Cobol can do pointer arithmetic.
2014-12-01 01:48:50	wartech0	Java, C#, and the like are all interpreted langauges
2014-12-01 01:48:52	Antman-	C and C++ can still interact with the hardware a bit (though not hardware-specific features like specific instructions)
2014-12-01 01:48:54	wartech0	languages*
2014-12-01 01:49:01	Antman-	Java, Python, Perl, generally run on a virtual machine.
2014-12-01 01:49:07	wartech0	while C C++ etc are all compiled
2014-12-01 01:49:14	Antman-	Java, for instance, is designed to run on the JVM
2014-12-01 01:49:19	wartech0	Antman-, yea... JIT I guess I should say
2014-12-01 01:49:22	MJBrune	C# is also a virtal machine language.
2014-12-01 01:49:27	Antman-	JIT is still compiled with the JVM as the reference target.
2014-12-01 01:49:35	MJBrune	or well as much as it is in say Ruby or perl.
2014-12-01 01:49:35	%Tsugumi	....
2014-12-01 01:49:55	%Tsugumi	C++ and C both have virtual machines for which the standards are written against.
2014-12-01 01:50:03	Antman-	Tsugumi - yes, but those VMs are far more lax.
2014-12-01 01:50:06	MJBrune	I'd say C# is as high of level as java.
2014-12-01 01:50:07	wartech0	I think the thing to realize here is that the interpretation of the produced output is being interpreted by software
2014-12-01 01:50:10	wartech0	and not hardware
2014-12-01 01:50:10	%Tsugumi	The same as Java and C#. Neither of which run in virtual machines.
2014-12-01 01:50:26	MJBrune	Tsugumi: JVM is a VM.
2014-12-01 01:50:37	%Tsugumi	no, it's not. It's just a runtime really
2014-12-01 01:50:42	Antman-	MJBrune - what he means it that Java itself doesn't care particularly about the JVM, only that its executing environment matches the specification.
2014-12-01 01:50:46	%Tsugumi	With a bit of GC on the side.
2014-12-01 01:50:46	wartech0	Java bytecode or C# bytecode is ran by virtual machines
2014-12-01 01:51:04	Antman-	Which is the same as C or C++, but I'd argue that their definition of the execution environment is vastly more lax.
2014-12-01 01:51:11	Antman-	Case in point: Undefined or Implementation-defined Behavior.
2014-12-01 01:51:21	MJBrune	I think this question answers our issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9556354/if-c-sharp-is-not-interpreted-then-why-vm-is-needed
2014-12-01 01:51:27	wartech0	whoa whoa whoa C/C++ is ran as pure machine code
2014-12-01 01:51:33	wartech0	well produced output
2014-12-01 01:51:33	Antman-	C# can be compiled directly to machine code, and can also run 'unsafe' code (pointers).
2014-12-01 01:51:37	Antman-	I've seen kernels written in it.
2014-12-01 01:51:46	wartech0	well so could java theoretically
2014-12-01 01:51:49	Antman-	It just ends up looking like bizarre C++, though.
2014-12-01 01:51:54	MJBrune	You could also write kernels in Java
2014-12-01 01:51:58	Antman-	Aye. Harder.
2014-12-01 01:52:05	Antman-	Java was very much not designed to be able to do that.
2014-12-01 01:52:10	wartech0	yea you are going to lose high level language constructs when you do that though
2014-12-01 01:52:29	MJBrune	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaOS
2014-12-01 01:52:31	MJBrune	it wasn't?
2014-12-01 01:52:36	Antman-	wartech0 - one advantage of C++ is that all the high level constructs are actually designed in the same language (std::vector is just a header class), so you can rebuild them to be sane for a kernel environment.
2014-12-01 01:52:47	@zao	Antman-: Not really.
2014-12-01 01:52:54	MJBrune	Java wasn't specifically designed to do it, but it wasn't specifically designed not to do it.
2014-12-01 01:52:55	%Tsugumi	java runs on a variety of hardware platforms, natively.
2014-12-01 01:52:58	@zao	Fair bit of non-header-only code in the typical SC++L.
2014-12-01 01:52:59	Antman-	zao - not all of them, but some.
2014-12-01 01:53:04	Antman-	true.
2014-12-01 01:53:09	@zao	Antman-: And they build on userland primitives.
2014-12-01 01:53:15	Antman-	Also true.
2014-12-01 01:53:18	MJBrune	Tsugumi: until you change CPU arch.
2014-12-01 01:53:34	%Tsugumi	MJBrune: you don't change CPU architectures in embedded platforms.
2014-12-01 01:53:36	@zao	http://www.bash.org/?338364 <- mandatory quote
2014-12-01 01:53:37	Antman-	But it does give you the ability to define your own high level classes that make sense for your operating environment, and was designed to do that.
2014-12-01 01:53:51	%Tsugumi	and there are plenty of embedded CPUs that can run java bytecode natively.
2014-12-01 01:54:01	Rotaerk	whoa, I forgot about bash.org
2014-12-01 01:54:08	MJBrune	Tsugumi: Sure, and I am not saying that they do.
2014-12-01 01:54:11	wartech0	Rotaerk, how do you forget about bash...
2014-12-01 01:54:15	Antman-	MJBrune - what is the kernel written in?
2014-12-01 01:54:19	Antman-	The OS can be written in whatever you want.
2014-12-01 01:54:22	Rotaerk	it's just been so long since someone mentioned/linked it
2014-12-01 01:54:23	MJBrune	Antman-: java
2014-12-01 01:54:25	Antman-	so long as the kernel can understand it.
2014-12-01 01:54:34	@zao	Rotaerk: Been rather stale for a good while.
2014-12-01 01:54:38	@zao	qdb has taken up some of the load.
2014-12-01 01:54:47	%Tsugumi	also, a great deal of C++ involves a lot of backend work that is not constructive in a kernel environment
2014-12-01 01:54:49	Antman-	I'm suspicious of the kernel being entirely Java, since at some point assembly or C(++) must be used.
2014-12-01 01:54:56	%Tsugumi	static initialization being a great fun one.
2014-12-01 01:55:08	Antman-	Static initialization isn't difficult, even at the kernel level.
2014-12-01 01:55:25	Antman-	My kernel is C++, I simply extract the constructor addresses and call them :D
2014-12-01 01:55:33	Antman-	that loading code is not kept around afterwards anyways.
2014-12-01 01:55:35	wartech0	instructions go in, data comes out, you can't explain that!
2014-12-01 01:55:39	%Tsugumi	it is quite difficult, at the kernel level. A lot more difficult than "not having it at all."
2014-12-01 01:55:50	Antman-	I didn't have any difficulty with it.
2014-12-01 01:56:02	Antman-	The procedure for static initialization is only a few lines.
2014-12-01 01:56:05	%Tsugumi	also, raw pointers is not a very good example of why C++ is good. Raw pointers are like 99% of the problem with C++ code.
2014-12-01 01:56:32	Antman-	presuming, of course, you already have the address of the CTORs
2014-12-01 01:56:33	%Tsugumi	and, you can do pointer manipulation in python if you REALLY wanted, it has the ability to call into C functions, which means it can pass around arbitrary addresses.
2014-12-01 01:56:49	wartech0	man you are not manipulating pointers man
2014-12-01 01:56:53	Antman-	Aye. C and C++ were designed originally to do that, though.
2014-12-01 01:56:53	wartech0	its all just data man...
2014-12-01 01:57:03	%Tsugumi	no, C and C++ were not "designed"
2014-12-01 01:57:06	%Tsugumi	which is part of the problem.
2014-12-01 01:57:11	MJBrune	Basically thats true
2014-12-01 01:57:13	Antman-	C was designed. By many different people. Simultaneously.
2014-12-01 01:57:19	Antman-	Over a very long period of time.
2014-12-01 01:57:26	wartech0	Tsugumi, man why you always have to see things so black and white man...
2014-12-01 01:57:30	MJBrune	as much as I like C++ it wasn't really "designed" or layered out.
2014-12-01 01:57:43	@zao	wartech0: He ate MJ.
2014-12-01 01:57:45	Antman-	C++ was designed very clearly. I just disagree with the decisions the designers made quite often.
2014-12-01 01:58:05	wartech0	zao MJ?
2014-12-01 01:58:06	MJBrune	At least not like the languages that came after it
2014-12-01 01:58:11	%Tsugumi	there was no design for C++, C++ came around long before "language designers" were a thing.
2014-12-01 01:58:11	wartech0	Michel Jordan?!
2014-12-01 01:58:12	MJBrune	wartech0: me apparently.
2014-12-01 01:58:16	wartech0	oh
2014-12-01 01:58:19	Antman-	Tsugumi - the more recent specs were designed in committee.
2014-12-01 01:58:23	wartech0	oh...
2014-12-01 01:58:29	Antman-	the base language wasn't, though.
2014-12-01 01:58:36	wartech0	I was going to say why is he eating former basketball players?
2014-12-01 01:58:48	%Tsugumi	you can see this due to the many inconsitencies in the language, the difference in terminologies even throughout the standard, and the fact that many parts of it are in pseudo conflict with many other parts (hello addressof)
2014-12-01 01:58:50	MJBrune	Antman-: exactly, if you look at something like ruby or even java you see a much better design pattern there.
2014-12-01 01:58:57	wartech0	haha
2014-12-01 01:58:59	wartech0	ha...
2014-12-01 01:59:00	@zao	Antman-: Committee doesn't design things, they just approve of shit.
2014-12-01 01:59:01	wartech0	Ruby...
2014-12-01 01:59:08	MJBrune	Whats wrong with ruby?
2014-12-01 01:59:14	wartech0	hahaha
2014-12-01 01:59:22	%Tsugumi	The committee doesn't "design" the language, they approve proposals and wording
2014-12-01 01:59:24	%Tsugumi	that's about it.
2014-12-01 01:59:26	Antman-	zao - is there a true difference between writing the proposals, or choosing which proposals to approve of?
2014-12-01 01:59:29	@zao	That there's an overlap in people who write N-papers and people who convene is a bit of a happenstance.
2014-12-01 01:59:36	wartech0	MJBrune, I don't know that there is any thing super wrong with it
2014-12-01 01:59:36	Antman-	In the end, if you can approve/reject proposals, you have design powers over a project.
2014-12-01 01:59:37	@zao	That's what the dictators say.
2014-12-01 01:59:41	wartech0	other then its fucked up syntax
2014-12-01 01:59:50	MJBrune	wartech0: whats wrong with the syntax?
2014-12-01 02:00:01	wartech0	its unnecessary
2014-12-01 02:00:03	MJBrune	Everything is an object. Its a complete OOP language.
2014-12-01 02:00:12	MJBrune	unlike C++ which isn't a full OOP language
2014-12-01 02:00:12	Antman-	Maybe not everything needs to be an object.
2014-12-01 02:00:23	 *	Antman- doesn't like boxing.
2014-12-01 02:00:24	MJBrune	There are other languages for that Antman-
2014-12-01 02:00:55	Antman-	MJBrune - the JavaOS kernel, as best I can tell, is ASM and C.
2014-12-01 02:01:07	Antman-	which implements basic system functionality and a JVM.
2014-12-01 02:01:10	MJBrune	Ruby is simple OOP boiled down and refined the way it should be when you want a PURE OOP environment
2014-12-01 02:01:11	wartech0	MJBrune, yea... which is god
2014-12-01 02:01:13	wartech0	good*
2014-12-01 02:01:17	wartech0	everything as an object
2014-12-01 02:01:19	wartech0	is a stupid idea
2014-12-01 02:01:27	wartech0	that leads to shit like singletons
2014-12-01 02:01:27	rajkosto	why would i want a PURE OOP environment ?
2014-12-01 02:01:44	rajkosto	mix and match paradigms, use whats best for your problem
2014-12-01 02:01:56	%Tsugumi	OOP has very little to do with "objects"
2014-12-01 02:02:05	%Tsugumi	and a great deal to do with interfaces and responsibility segregation.
2014-12-01 02:02:19	MJBrune	rajkosto: in certain projects like sites and back end coding, ruby is very awesome and benefits a lot from being full OOP
2014-12-01 02:02:38	@zao	Ultimate goal of OO is to blame everyone else.
2014-12-01 02:02:41	rajkosto	you dont even know what you are talking about
2014-12-01 02:02:44	rajkosto	good day
2014-12-01 02:02:44	MJBrune	wartech0: Most game engines have singletons
2014-12-01 02:03:00	Antman-	MJBrune - mine doesn't.
2014-12-01 02:03:01	Antman-	:D
2014-12-01 02:03:24	MJBrune	Antman-: which is nice, mine didn't have one either and was very awesome as well.
2014-12-01 02:03:28	@zao	Antman- has a balrog at a tea party.
2014-12-01 02:03:40	MJBrune	But singletons aren't automatically bad.
2014-12-01 02:03:50	Antman-	zao - not just ANY balrog
2014-12-01 02:03:53	wartech0	oh yes they are
2014-12-01 02:04:02	wartech0	singletons are the embodiment of everything that is terrible
2014-12-01 02:04:11	wartech0	and if you use them
2014-12-01 02:04:21	wartech0	I will send you to the gulag for 'reeducation'
2014-12-01 02:04:32	Antman-	zao - gothmog himself.
2014-12-01 02:06:20	wartech0	and also Ogre is not most game engines
2014-12-01 02:06:32	Antman-	Ogre isn't a game engine, period.
2014-12-01 02:06:41	MJBrune	UE4 has singletons in it.
2014-12-01 02:06:49	Antman-	UE4 isn't that different from UE3.
2014-12-01 02:06:50	wartech0	Ogre is a cluster fuck of bad design
2014-12-01 02:06:57	MJBrune	Antman-: its fairly different.
2014-12-01 02:07:04	Antman-	Not really.
2014-12-01 02:07:19	MJBrune	you obviously haven't tried moving a game to UE4 from UE3
2014-12-01 02:07:27	MJBrune	or even UE4 to UE4
2014-12-01 02:07:32	Antman-	Not that I can talk about.
2014-12-01 02:08:05	Antman-	NDAs are fun.
2014-12-01 02:08:11	MJBrune	lets just put it this way. In UE4 4.6 they are removing all PCIP functionalities.
2014-12-01 02:08:24	MJBrune	Thats the major way objects in UE4 are constructed.
2014-12-01 02:08:48	Antman-	I'm not a gameplay programmer. Irrelevant to me.
2014-12-01 02:09:03	MJBrune	Also NDA's don't block you on saying you are working on A project. It just says you can't say which or such.
2014-12-01 02:09:07	Antman-	I was mildly confused why UE4 had a Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, though.
2014-12-01 02:09:14	MJBrune	at least most the time.
2014-12-01 02:09:15	Antman-	MJBrune - specifying more would make it obvious what I'm working on.
2014-12-01 02:09:37	MJBrune	I feel like you don't know what UE4 PCIP is
2014-12-01 02:09:48	Antman-	Because I do engine/system-side work.
2014-12-01 02:09:51	Antman-	Never had to touch the object layer.
2014-12-01 02:09:56	Antman-	Nor do I want to.
2014-12-01 02:10:24	%Tsugumi	you've obviously never signed the kinds of NDAs i've seen.
2014-12-01 02:10:34	%Tsugumi	because tehy can prevent you from talking about projects.
2014-12-01 02:10:49	MJBrune	Tsugumi: I am not saying you can talk about the project.
2014-12-01 02:11:09	MJBrune	I am saying that you can state you are working on a UE4 project. Just not for what company or such.

2014-12-01 02:11:42	@zao	MJBrune: Depends on whom the NDA is with.
2014-12-01 02:11:54	MJBrune	Of course it all depends on whats actually written
2014-12-01 02:11:57	Antman-	That, and not everyone uses the vanilla engine.
2014-12-01 02:12:07	Antman-	So sometimes, talking about it makes it obvious what you're working on.
2014-12-01 02:12:07	MJBrune	I certainly don't use the vanilla engine :)
2014-12-01 02:12:34	MJBrune	Anyways if you used UE4 before 4.6 then you have used this: https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/CoreUObject/UObject/FPostConstructInitializeProperti-/index.html
2014-12-01 02:12:41	MJBrune	which is going away in the next version.
2014-12-01 02:12:46	Antman-	As said, I do graphics and systems design.
2014-12-01 02:12:49	Antman-	I never have to touch that stuff at all
2014-12-01 02:12:51	Antman-	ever.
2014-12-01 02:12:56	Antman-	I have no idea how Unreal's object system works.
2014-12-01 02:13:12	MJBrune	I thought you said you did engine and systems
2014-12-01 02:13:21	MJBrune	i guess you meant graphics. I was confused.
2014-12-01 02:13:23	Antman-	Perhaps what we call 'engine' means something different between us.
2014-12-01 02:13:48	Antman-	I normally do graphics and general systems (platform, compatibility)
2014-12-01 02:13:56	Antman-	Meaning I operate at the deeper levels of the engine.
2014-12-01 02:14:03	Antman-	I have no idea what goes on above it.
2014-12-01 02:14:15	MJBrune	mhmm

2014-12-01 02:21:33	%Tsugumi	why would you re-render text every frame?
2014-12-01 02:21:45	Antman-	Because this is America, and I value the freedom to do such.
2014-12-01 02:21:53	Antman-	Also, I want to know absolute worst-case performance.
2014-12-01 02:22:08	@zao	Your cycles are true heroes.
2014-12-01 02:22:13	Antman-	which equates to someone dragging around or rotating constantly a window that has subpixel-aligned text.

2014-12-01 15:51:26	rajkosto	so why not maintain a 32bit d3d9 xp compat version
2014-12-01 15:51:34	rajkosto	and a x86_64 d3d11 ps4-equivalent
2014-12-01 15:51:36	Sirisian|Work	They basically said they have nobody using x86 in the us or europe. It's just china atm.
2014-12-01 15:51:51	rajkosto	china don't care
2014-12-01 15:51:58	Sirisian|Work	They actually switched to 64-bit for the US and europe clients. You have to manually go into the game to execute the x86 :P

2014-12-01 17:37:41	@MikeP	the most efficient way is to have it not move at all

2014-12-01 18:01:21	Sirisian|Work	yeah it could just be interacting with the earth's magnetic field. I think they said they tested for that though.
2014-12-01 18:01:22	ace4016	wouldn't really be a rocket
2014-12-01 18:02:18	Sirisian|Work	yeah with lockheed's fusion reactor and all the other fusion reactor ideas the idea of going from electricity to thrust in space is tempting. Being able to steer around the ISS or move a satellite for free would be fun.
2014-12-01 18:02:44	Roy_Fokker	doesn't emdrive have pityful output for energy consumed
2014-12-01 18:02:56	Roy_Fokker	so it's not going to be pushing anything much
2014-12-01 18:03:02	Roy_Fokker	unless it's super long terms
2014-12-01 18:03:10	Roy_Fokker	Out-Sol satellites
2014-12-01 18:03:12	Sirisian|Work	nah it's actually really high conversion rate. And those are the theorhetical lower bounds according to the researcher.
2014-12-01 18:03:22	Sirisian|Work	oh yeah you aren't taking off with them probably.
2014-12-01 18:03:39	ace4016	Sirisian|Work, you keep using the word free:  frankly, i am more interested in SABRE engine
2014-12-01 18:03:39	ace4016	[18:29] <Roy_Fokker> Jet
2014-12-01 18:03:45	mikeman	Roy_Fokker: from what I understand, if you're out of earht's grav field, even a tiny acceleration over a constant time actually results in pretty high speeds
2014-12-01 18:03:50	Sirisian|Work	really depends if it scales up which they said it should.
2014-12-01 18:03:54	ace4016	err... Sirisian|Work, http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcv3axze2w1qdhsxp.jpg
2014-12-01 18:04:05	Roy_Fokker	hmm?
2014-12-01 18:04:35	Sirisian|Work	which word?
2014-12-01 18:04:41	ace4016	free
2014-12-01 18:04:43	mikeman	you know, the saddest thing is, probably the best thing we can achieve, ever, is make "vacation on mars" a reality, at some point :P
2014-12-01 18:04:49	Roy_Fokker	ace4016, SABRE is jet/rocket hybrid engine!?
2014-12-01 18:04:50	mikeman	we're not gonna visit any solar systems
2014-12-01 18:04:50	Sirisian|Work	ace4016, solar energy is free.
2014-12-01 18:05:06	Sirisian|Work	solar energy -> battery -> thrust
2014-12-01 18:05:29	ace4016	because the panels and battery require no maintenance
2014-12-01 18:05:42	ace4016	and were produced automagically
2014-12-01 18:06:03	mikeman	well, he said the energy was free, not manufacturing and maintaining the machinery :)
2014-12-01 18:06:15	Roy_Fokker	i donno
2014-12-01 18:06:19	Roy_Fokker	nothing is free
2014-12-01 18:06:35	mikeman	oh sure, even the sun is gonna run out at some point, okay :P
2014-12-01 18:06:37	Roy_Fokker	and converting solar energy to usable something, always generates heat
2014-12-01 18:06:43	Roy_Fokker	HEAT is a bitch to get rid off
2014-12-01 18:06:51	Roy_Fokker	ruins everything
2014-12-01 18:06:54	Roy_Fokker	fuck HEAT
2014-12-01 18:07:24	mikeman	bah, I usually hide from the cops for a while, and the HEAT meter drops in a while
2014-12-01 18:07:26	ace4016	mikeman, in that case, the energy in gas is free too
2014-12-01 18:07:49	ace4016	you just have to pay for the medium to make it useable
2014-12-01 18:07:50	ace4016	:P
2014-12-01 18:07:52	ace4016	>:D
2014-12-01 18:07:55	mikeman	but solar energy is practically limitless
2014-12-01 18:08:22	mikeman	it's gonna be there for the next 5 billion years whether you use it or not :P
2014-12-01 18:08:32	ace4016	solar energy is also fairly low density
2014-12-01 18:10:18	mikeman	dammit, it's like god has made interstellar travel purposefully impossible so we're unlikely to meet any aliens and ask questions like "did you have a jesus too"? :P
2014-12-01 18:10:43	Roy_Fokker	perhaps because god doesn't exist

2014-12-01 18:11:36	Roy_Fokker	at this rate i might as well re-write it
2014-12-01 18:13:23	Sirisian|Work	ace4016, I'm more interested in this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_optical_interferometry There was a cool article about that which basically showed with a few well positioned sattelites that high resolution images of planets light years away can be taken.
2014-12-01 18:14:18	Sirisian|Work	http://www.citizensinspace.org/2012/03/rethinking-the-webb-space-telescope/
2014-12-01 18:15:20	ace4016	i thought that was a fairly old concept
2014-12-01 18:15:40	Sirisian|Work	it is. The article says it's high risk apparently
2014-12-01 18:15:55	Sirisian|Work	probably because it's complex with multiple sattelites
2014-12-01 18:16:15	mikeman	hey look, a game made by a greek team that looks like an actual PC game :P

2014-12-01 21:03:56	@zao	Ask one of the foooools.
2014-12-01 21:04:09	+Jovan	fucc dat chyt
2014-12-01 21:04:49	+Jovan	It is unfortunate that most, if not all MMOs, are locked down to begin with and don't really do a whole lot of change with xpacks.. maybe some new things are brought in depending on the xpack and the population counts
2014-12-01 21:05:08	+Jovan	but it would be nice to see a UO that on a regular basis, not just an xpack, adds new things
2014-12-01 21:05:15	+Jovan	a lot to ask for but, it is supposed to be an MMO after all
2014-12-01 21:07:31	+Jovan	like if you're going to release something like hey you can have your own houses and shit
2014-12-01 21:07:48	+Jovan	actively push out new types of masonry building blocks and whatever have you

2014-12-01 21:26:08	Mushu	wartech0: I said basically, the only place that makes sense is when you're deriving key material
2014-12-01 21:26:17	Mushu	in which case you'd better be usking pbkdf2
2014-12-01 21:26:23	Mushu	or I will find you and murder you in your sleep
2014-12-01 21:26:31	%Rawr	well its a CTF
2014-12-01 21:26:41	%Rawr	so i'm guessing they have a weakened key derivation step

2014-12-01 22:27:01	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: they really need to add enchanting
2014-12-01 22:27:13	Mushu	or just higher-tier equipment
2014-12-01 22:27:41	@KnightTemplar	well, from what I gather all the higher-tier equipment will be player created
2014-12-01 22:27:49	Mushu	makes sense
2014-12-01 22:28:12	@KnightTemplar	In fact, according to stuff on the forums when you sell stuff to vendors they will keep some but the rest will get put into loot tables
2014-12-01 22:28:13	Mushu	realistically, at this point they don't even have crafting profession abilities yet, so, berllgh
2014-12-01 22:28:18	@KnightTemplar	So mobs will drop player-created items
2014-12-01 22:28:24	Mushu	huh
2014-12-01 22:28:28	Mushu	that's kind of awkward
2014-12-01 22:28:34	Mushu	I was hoping NPC vendors wouldn't really buy anything
2014-12-01 22:28:47	@KnightTemplar	so, basically, the only way to garauntee that you get quality items would be to buy them from players
2014-12-01 22:28:47	Mushu	you'd have to sell them via, effectively, consignment shops
2014-12-01 22:28:59	@KnightTemplar	Well, everyone will be able to have a vendor at their house
2014-12-01 22:29:08	Mushu	(if they have a house, kekeke)
2014-12-01 22:29:12	@KnightTemplar	heh
2014-12-01 22:29:13	@KnightTemplar	ya
2014-12-01 22:29:16	Mushu	there's also the auction thing planned
2014-12-01 22:29:21	Mushu	for people that don't want / can't have a house
2014-12-01 22:29:28	@KnightTemplar	or sell through players that have a house and vendor
2014-12-01 22:29:35	@KnightTemplar	I thought the auction thing wasn't happening
2014-12-01 22:29:39	Mushu	oh I dunno
2014-12-01 22:29:46	Mushu	I'm not really up-to-date
2014-12-01 22:31:43	@KnightTemplar	I need to figure out wtf the difference is between town and city lots
2014-12-01 22:31:46	Mushu	ooh, the roadmap for the next release looks great
2014-12-01 22:31:49	Mushu	KnightTemplar: size, I think
2014-12-01 22:31:56	Mushu	"Combat: Stealth mechanics will begin to appear."
2014-12-01 22:31:58	Mushu	hurrah
2014-12-01 22:32:07	@KnightTemplar	Well, I mean... what are towns and what are cities?
2014-12-01 22:32:14	Mushu	arbitrary
2014-12-01 22:32:16	Mushu	I guess
2014-12-01 22:32:29	@KnightTemplar	Where'd you see the roadmap?
2014-12-01 22:34:27	Mushu	https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?page_id=44949
2014-12-01 22:35:22	@KnightTemplar	oooh... crafting that might make better items? :)
2014-12-01 22:35:36	Ameisen	I'm trying to figure out if java moss inhibits the growth of algae in an aquarium
2014-12-01 22:35:45	Ameisen	in two of my aquariums, no algae grows anywhere near the java moss
2014-12-01 22:35:46	Mushu	KnightTemplar: this details the different lot sizes a bit better: https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?page_id=44577
2014-12-01 22:35:48	Ameisen	but everywhere else.
2014-12-01 22:35:59	Lorentz	in my experience, it does by starving nutrients for algae to grow
2014-12-01 22:36:02	Lorentz	it's a competitor
2014-12-01 22:36:10	Ameisen	well, the thing is
2014-12-01 22:36:12	Ameisen	I have two pico tanks
2014-12-01 22:36:20	Ameisen	the 4G is doing well, only 'fuzz' algae and only on glas
2014-12-01 22:36:21	Ameisen	glass
2014-12-01 22:36:29	Ameisen	and _anywhere_ the java moss has attached itself, including teh glass
2014-12-01 22:36:35	Ameisen	the algae doesn't grow within about 5mm
2014-12-01 22:36:46	Ameisen	In my 2G pico, the algae grows EVERYWHERE, including on mini weeping moss
2014-12-01 22:36:47	@KnightTemplar	ah
2014-12-01 22:36:55	Ameisen	but there's a small clump of java moss in the back that is 100% algae free
2014-12-01 22:36:57	Lorentz	hmm, that kind of growth / lack there of, I don't know
2014-12-01 22:37:11	Ameisen	Hence my current hypothesis that java moss excretes an antialgal
2014-12-01 22:37:32	Ameisen	Which would make sense - java moss grows in slow streams, where algae could easily choke it out
2014-12-01 22:37:33	@KnightTemplar	I guess ideally I'd like a town/city lot and a village lot :)
2014-12-01 22:38:46	Ameisen	If it were just one tank I'd be skeptical
2014-12-01 22:38:54	Ameisen	but _two_ tanks show similar behavior - algae everywhere but near the java moss
2014-12-01 22:39:05	Ameisen	since tank #1 has a ton of java moss, very little algae
2014-12-01 22:39:13	Ameisen	before the java moss bloomed, algae was a problem.
2014-12-01 22:42:01	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: The 5-story basement is HUGE
2014-12-01 22:42:05	Mushu	KnightTemplar: heh
2014-12-01 22:42:28	@KnightTemplar	Like... enormous
2014-12-01 22:42:39	Mushu	KnightTemplar: also, if you want guarenteed stuff: https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?page_id=9085#addon-row_lot_property_deeds__digital_

2014-12-01 22:42:45	@zao	Heh.
2014-12-01 22:43:05	Mushu	But at those rates you might as well buy one of these: https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?page_id=41907
2014-12-01 22:43:13	@KnightTemplar	lol
2014-12-01 22:43:18	@KnightTemplar	$450 for a town lot?
2014-12-01 22:43:35	Mushu	or $750 for your own town
2014-12-01 22:43:48	Mushu	pretty sure I'd just find a friend if I was gonna drop that kind of cash
2014-12-01 22:43:52	Mushu	and split the town
2014-12-01 22:44:07	@KnightTemplar	Let's do it!
2014-12-01 22:44:17	@zao	Mushu: 750 for a "holdfast".
2014-12-01 22:44:20	@zao	Town is 3k.
2014-12-01 22:44:26	Mushu	zao: 12600m^2
2014-12-01 22:44:57	@zao	"Player run towns do not include the lot deeds"
2014-12-01 22:44:57	Mushu	hrm, that's 112x112m
2014-12-01 22:45:05	CobaltHex	lol
2014-12-01 22:45:05	CobaltHex	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJgLa3eKMYs
2014-12-01 22:45:09	Mushu	zao: yes, but people can't buy lots in your town unless you decide to sell them
2014-12-01 22:45:12	@KnightTemplar	zao: That's fine, you can buy the lot deeds in the game
2014-12-01 22:45:15	Mushu	zao: so they're pretty much reserved
2014-12-01 22:45:17	@KnightTemplar	ya
2014-12-01 22:45:30	@KnightTemplar	"Owner of the keys can lock and unlock lots at will so they can actively control who gets to live there"
2014-12-01 22:45:44	Mushu	anyway, given that village lots are 600m^2, I figure a holdfast will have 4-5 village lots
2014-12-01 22:46:07	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: A holdfast can have 21 village lots
2014-12-01 22:46:15	@KnightTemplar	?Lot Selection: Determine which lots of which size you want. For example at this size: ?21 Village Lots
2014-12-01 22:46:15	@KnightTemplar	?5 Village Lots + 1 Castle Lot
2014-12-01 22:46:15	Mushu	what, where are you seeing that
2014-12-01 22:46:15	@KnightTemplar	?20 Row Lots + 1 Castle Lot
2014-12-01 22:46:15	@KnightTemplar	?13 Village Lots + 1 Keep
2014-12-01 22:46:15	@KnightTemplar	?13 Village Lots + 4 Town Lots
2014-12-01 22:46:20	Mushu	hot damn
2014-12-01 22:46:22	@KnightTemplar	Click on it :P
2014-12-01 22:46:34	Mushu	ah derp, javascript was disabled
2014-12-01 22:46:48	Mushu	oh wow though
2014-12-01 22:46:51	Mushu	KnightTemplar: castle lot.
2014-12-01 22:46:52	Mushu	Why not.
2014-12-01 22:47:39	Mushu	holy crap, a hamlet is the size of kingsport.
2014-12-01 22:47:51	%Rawr	mmm, ham.
2014-12-01 22:48:13	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: I wouldn't go with a castle lot because you'd want to divide the biggest lots amongst all your investors
2014-12-01 22:48:37	Mushu	yeah. and realistically, you'd have 1 town lot/investor +N village/row lots for each to give to friends
2014-12-01 22:48:42	Ameisen	Wait... you actually have to buy property in that game
2014-12-01 22:48:44	Ameisen	with actual money
2014-12-01 22:48:52	Mushu	Ameisen: you can use in-game currency too
2014-12-01 22:48:54	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: or sell to the public
2014-12-01 22:48:59	@KnightTemplar	for giant piles of cash
2014-12-01 22:49:08	Mushu	KnightTemplar: Eh, depends on how the rental system works out
2014-12-01 22:49:41	Ameisen	Mushu - so, pay-to-win?
2014-12-01 22:49:44	@KnightTemplar	Ameisen: No
2014-12-01 22:49:47	@KnightTemplar	What are you winning?
2014-12-01 22:49:50	Ameisen	property
2014-12-01 22:49:54	Ameisen	the internet american dream
2014-12-01 22:49:56	@KnightTemplar	That's not winning
2014-12-01 22:50:36	Mushu	yeah, that's true, property doesn't really convey much advantage in-game
2014-12-01 22:50:42	Mushu	The /home teleport is really nice though
2014-12-01 22:51:21	+Jovan	wait what the fuck
2014-12-01 22:51:27	+Jovan	shroud of the avatar is sellign shit for $15?
2014-12-01 22:51:28	@KnightTemplar	ya, it is
2014-12-01 22:51:58	Ameisen	Mushu - I'd rather play a game where property was an advantage but could only be bought with in-game currency
2014-12-01 22:52:01	Ameisen	but it's harder to profit off that.
2014-12-01 22:52:07	Mushu	KnightTemplar: I'm really tempted for some reason.
2014-12-01 22:52:19	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: I'd do a hamlet if we can get 2 more people :)
2014-12-01 22:52:23	+Jovan	WAIT HOLY SHIT
2014-12-01 22:52:29	+Jovan	i recently saw a film with john boyega
2014-12-01 22:52:31	@KnightTemplar	er... holdfast
2014-12-01 22:52:31	+Jovan	attack the block
2014-12-01 22:52:33	+Jovan	it was hilarious
2014-12-01 22:52:41	Mushu	Yeah, what the hell, I'm down for a holdfast 4 ways.
2014-12-01 22:54:02	Mushu	I can't really think of anyone else that would do this
2014-12-01 22:54:16	Mushu	Everyone I know has already thrown down cash for star citizen
2014-12-01 22:55:06	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: "There will be a path to achieve this in game via in game gold purchase but the ownership of the scene will incur a rental fee"
2014-12-01 22:55:48	Mushu	Yeah. Not to mention it'll likely be an occassional auction.
2014-12-01 22:57:07	@KnightTemplar	Kingsport has town lots and village lots
2014-12-01 22:58:00	+Jovan	KnightTemplar, so are you enjoying SOtA?
2014-12-01 22:58:00	Mushu	Yeah, the lot selection says "etc", so it's likely fairly open to interpretation
2014-12-01 22:58:43	@KnightTemplar	right
2014-12-01 22:58:53	@KnightTemplar	Jovan: A qualified yes
2014-12-01 22:59:20	+Jovan	whats the qualified bit there
2014-12-01 22:59:47	@KnightTemplar	It's not done
2014-12-01 23:00:39	+Jovan	from the sounds of they have... "episodes" too?
2014-12-01 23:00:46	+Jovan	"mounts are not available in episode 1" ?
2014-12-01 23:00:51	+Jovan	how the fuck is this UO?
2014-12-01 23:01:10	@KnightTemplar	It's not UO
2014-12-01 23:01:27	@KnightTemplar	Jovan: The biggest issue with playing it right now is the lack of equipment above introduction-tier
2014-12-01 23:01:27	+Jovan	HOW THE
2014-12-01 23:01:35	+Jovan	well he said "it might as well be called UO2 if i had the rights to the name"
2014-12-01 23:01:52	+Jovan	KnightTemplar, how much did you pay for it again?
2014-12-01 23:02:40	@KnightTemplar	Jovan: $38?
2014-12-01 23:03:26	+Jovan	KnightTemplar, should i get a blu-ray pack of star wars ep 1 - 6?
2014-12-01 23:03:48	@KnightTemplar	I don't know?
2014-12-01 23:04:02	+Jovan	$38 followed by an I don't know, hmm
2014-12-01 23:04:08	+Jovan	unstable reaction
2014-12-01 23:04:22	@KnightTemplar	I have no idea wtf you're talking about
2014-12-01 23:04:23	+Jovan	You're right, it's not worth the $38
2014-12-01 23:04:30	+Jovan	I thought i pledged like
2014-12-01 23:04:30	Mushu	KnightTemplar: I wonder how many people have already purchased towns.
2014-12-01 23:04:33	+Jovan	$15 or something to SotA
2014-12-01 23:04:37	+Jovan	if only because i was a UO fag
2014-12-01 23:04:51	@KnightTemplar	Jovan: I don't care if you get SotA
2014-12-01 23:04:53	+Jovan	Mushu, these towns are paid for with real money i take it?
2014-12-01 23:05:32	@KnightTemplar	Mushu: I have no idea, I doubt it's just the ones that are in game right now
2014-12-01 23:05:39	Mushu	Likely.
2014-12-01 23:05:47	+Jovan	Mushu, that's uh...
2014-12-01 23:05:48	+Jovan	interesting
2014-12-01 23:05:48	Mushu	I wonder how they're going to fit them all in.
2014-12-01 23:06:07	Rotaerk	that's what she said
2014-12-01 23:06:36	@KnightTemplar	One of my buddies says he wants to see the game in a more polished state before he commits to a $200 "investment"
2014-12-01 23:06:42	+Jovan	lol
2014-12-01 23:06:47	+Jovan	your buddy must love second life
2014-12-01 23:06:49	Mushu	KnightTemplar: makes sense.
2014-12-01 23:06:50	+Jovan	and/or eve online
2014-12-01 23:07:03	+Jovan	does SotA's MMO thing cost extra on top?
2014-12-01 23:07:11	+Jovan	ie, do you pay $45 for the game and then $15/mo?
2014-12-01 23:07:26	@KnightTemplar	no
2014-12-01 23:07:36	+Jovan	how long is that "no" valid for?
2014-12-01 23:07:58	@KnightTemplar	how long is anything valid for?

2014-12-01 23:09:05	+Jovan	have they said something along the lines of early backers not having to pay subs?

2014-12-02 01:08:20	Ameisen	Is XINPUT/DInput maintained by window focus?
2014-12-02 01:08:29	Ameisen	IIRC, that's configurable, isn't it?
2014-12-02 01:09:04	@zao	Ameisen: Some games manage to grab input while defocused, and the developers should burn in hell for it.

2014-12-02 01:11:39	Ameisen	zao - well, my question goes along the lines of applications that have multiple windows
2014-12-02 01:11:56	Ameisen	for something like XInput/DInput, is there a way to capture the input discretely for a window instead of just for the application as a whole
2014-12-02 01:12:04	Ameisen	or would there even be a meaningful way for that to work
2014-12-02 01:12:30	@zao	Don't have any answer to that, sadly.
2014-12-02 01:12:33	 *	zao KISS
2014-12-02 01:14:17	Ameisen	zao - my API only allows input via a window object
2014-12-02 01:14:21	@zao	I could speculate, but that wouldn't help anyone much.
2014-12-02 01:14:24	Ameisen	that is, you register listeners with a window to receive input
2014-12-02 01:14:35	Ameisen	So, you fundamentally CAN'T receive input from an out of focus window
2014-12-02 01:14:50	Ameisen	I suppose it would make sense for 'global' inputs like controllers to just pass input through the active window.
2014-12-02 01:15:03	@zao	Correlate timestamps for focus events and timestamps for input events, filter it out and syntesise a consistent input state for each window?
2014-12-02 01:15:39	Ameisen	It's a tricky proble
2014-12-02 01:15:41	Ameisen	problem
2014-12-02 01:15:46	@zao	Or if lucky, bend your API into diddling as window messages instead of thread messages.
2014-12-02 01:15:51	Ameisen	if I press B on Window A, switch to Window B, and depress B...
2014-12-02 01:16:09	Ameisen	What does that become on the API side
2014-12-02 01:16:16	@zao	Go back to steady-state on defocus?
2014-12-02 01:16:21	Ameisen	that would work.
2014-12-02 01:16:31	Ameisen	Would Window B ignore the B-depress?
2014-12-02 01:16:37	Ameisen	since it was depressed originally from its view?
2014-12-02 01:17:13	Ameisen	I had this system working really well for mice and keyboards (could handle an arbitrary number of both independently, and also had a 'global' device for both) but I never stretched it to controllers
2014-12-02 01:17:24	@zao	Either that or recognize the button being down on focus.
2014-12-02 01:17:31	@zao	But that depends on the semantics you'd want.
2014-12-02 01:17:57	@zao	Some things you may want to re-trigger on window change if held, some things "belong" in the original.
2014-12-02 01:17:58	Ameisen	I will say that it made making a window that could be controlled by mouse/keyboard two lines of code
2014-12-02 01:17:59	Ameisen	which was nice
2014-12-02 01:18:56	Ameisen	I'm not 100% sure I'd be comfortable with a button press being maintained out of focus, since I presume that'd either imply: ignoring a state change, or propagating a state change to a non-active window.
2014-12-02 01:19:39	Ameisen	Alternatively, I could make inputs global and simply have them return a Window object (similar in concept to the windows message loop)
2014-12-02 01:19:47	Ameisen	and in my own code ignore it if the window object is nullptr
2014-12-02 01:20:03	Ameisen	Since, functionally, inputs are global.
2014-12-02 01:30:26	Ameisen	That might work better, since it helps eliminate ambiguity

2014-12-02 05:02:21	Brain	enjoy the lunch :p
2014-12-02 05:10:24	Brain	i think the best way would be:
2014-12-02 05:10:49	Brain	on click and hold, the item is raised up 'n' amount in the Y plane, so its obviously 'lifted'
2014-12-02 05:10:59	Brain	then dragging manpulates it in the X/Z planes
2014-12-02 05:11:13	Brain	letting your finger off the mouse button drops again lowering the Y back to zero
2014-12-02 05:11:29	Brain	that works fine unless i also want to manipulate Y, but i dont think i'd need that
2014-12-02 05:14:23	phantom	well 'raised up' is only a visual feedback thing... the axis of movement depends on the game/view in question... for example if you had something which was like a flat piece of ground which ended with a cliff and some more flat ground higher up then you could do the x/z movement and once you hit the cliff jump to the plane at the top which means y has now

2014-12-02 06:52:30	rajkohaxor	I'd love to have a Denuvo licence
2014-12-02 06:52:36	rajkohaxor	why wouldnt you use something like that
2014-12-02 06:52:41	rajkohaxor	other than performance
2014-12-02 06:52:51	rajkohaxor	but dont add integrity checks to perf critical areas

2014-12-02 07:54:24	Sirisian	<spoiler> meh I'll say it. They don't know what they were looking for. It's one of the biggest flaws of the plot. It's even admitted that they'd never be able to take all of humanity. The only people who knew what they were really searching for was the multidimensional humans that were leading them to the gravity equation.
2014-12-02 07:58:24	mikeman	again, seems like whatever installations you would build on another planet to support a colony, you could just do it on earth :)

2014-12-02 08:35:07	LaptopBrain	i have a class heirachy now which is; Window -> GameWindow -> FireworkFactoryWindow
2014-12-02 08:35:17	@MikeP	zao: Intel is an ampersand purist, of course
2014-12-02 08:35:22	wartech0	FireworkFactory is going to explode
2014-12-02 08:35:31	LaptopBrain	window contains raw win32 crud for displaying a window and handling its loop, GameWindow abstracts it to a Draw, Update etc method

2014-12-02 08:36:12	@KnightTemplar	rajkohaxor: wtf?
2014-12-02 08:36:34	LaptopBrain	then the FireworkFactoryWindow class is a game specific implementation
2014-12-02 08:36:37	wartech0	MikeP hmm I would be if there was a demonstrated better way
2014-12-02 08:36:40	wartech0	that made sense to me
2014-12-02 08:36:45	LaptopBrain	the idea is i can reuse the GameWindow class which behaves a bit like the Game class in XNA
2014-12-02 08:36:54	@MikeP	the better idea is composition 
2014-12-02 08:36:55	LaptopBrain	this isnt really overengineered right?

2014-12-02 08:38:30	LaptopBrain	i cant decide though if the DX11 class (directx 11 management class) should go in GameWindow ir FireworkFactoryWindow
2014-12-02 08:38:33	phantom	LaptopBrain: probably... mean, what does 'GameWindow' bring to the party that 'Window' couldn't handle? (Also why Window classes?)
2014-12-02 08:38:42	wartech0	LaptopBrain, well neither of course
2014-12-02 08:38:52	LaptopBrain	i guess if i stick it in FireworkFactoryWindow it keeps the GameWindow graphics library agnostic
2014-12-02 08:38:53	wartech0	the DX11 class should be its separate entity
2014-12-02 08:39:00	phantom	"DX11 class" feels all kinds of wrong...
2014-12-02 08:39:09	LaptopBrain	yeah it is, its not inherited, its instantiated from within one or the other

2014-12-02 08:39:35	wartech0	phantom meh I wrote a little class to handle DX11 stuff

2014-12-02 08:41:48	LaptopBrain	the only reason i threw it away is i decided that xna was pretty much a dead end and decided it was time to desert the sinking ship
2014-12-02 08:41:52	LaptopBrain	could have moved to monogame, but meh.
2014-12-02 08:42:05	wartech0	man XNA was a good framework too
2014-12-02 08:42:08	@zao	MikeP: In this case it's more of a convenience.
2014-12-02 08:42:16	@zao	MikeP: As you only need one cl.exe call in your build.bat :)
2014-12-02 08:42:29	wartech0	LaptopBrain, setting up a generalized XNA framework though
2014-12-02 08:42:31	@MikeP	he's a pretty opinionated guy. people like that are usually really annoying
2014-12-02 08:42:33	wartech0	isn't too terribly hard
2014-12-02 08:42:34	phantom	wartech0: 'class to handle dx11 stuff' also feels all kinds of wrong because you immediately make me think 'this is doing more than one thing' (and no, "handling DX11" isn't "one thing") which is bad...
2014-12-02 08:42:35	phantom	but..
2014-12-02 08:42:36	phantom	whatever
2014-12-02 08:42:47	wartech0	phantom, it was split up
2014-12-02 08:42:55	wartech0	like I said memory managers
2014-12-02 08:43:00	@MikeP	phantom: it's just typical overengineering 
2014-12-02 08:43:01	phantom	then you didn't have 'a class'
2014-12-02 08:43:06	phantom	so your statement was wrog
2014-12-02 08:43:07	phantom	but
2014-12-02 08:43:08	LaptopBrain	phantom: i agree, it is more than one thing, there is a scene, shaders, models, etc
2014-12-02 08:43:09	phantom	whatever
2014-12-02 08:43:23	phantom	I cba to correct other people's fucked designs so carry on
2014-12-02 08:43:35	wartech0	I don't think anyone can
2014-12-02 08:43:46	wartech0	you just got to kinda learn by burning yourself
2014-12-02 08:43:49	 *	zao git push --force \o/
2014-12-02 08:43:58	@MikeP	heathen
2014-12-02 08:44:04	wartech0	but I better get ready for work
2014-12-02 08:44:13	LaptopBrain	the class i have right now basically wraps a lot of the boilerplate stuff around ID3D11Device and ID3D11DeviceContext
2014-12-02 08:44:16	LaptopBrain	and a  bit of the swap chain
2014-12-02 08:44:26	@zao	MikeP: OCD over what crap I put in my pull requests, and the previous one was shit.
2014-12-02 08:44:26	LaptopBrain	the rest yeah, doesnt belong there
2014-12-02 08:44:44	@MikeP	zao: fair enough

2014-12-02 08:45:42	LaptopBrain	ok :P i'll quit my bitchin'
2014-12-02 08:45:48	LaptopBrain	because wrong metadata is damn annoying
2014-12-02 08:45:51	@zao	std::isfinite and ::isfinite are not guaranteed to be the same function.
2014-12-02 08:45:59	@zao	\o/
2014-12-02 08:46:20	wartech0	anyway LaptopBrain there is no right answer
2014-12-02 08:46:38	@MikeP	there are a lot of wrong answers though
2014-12-02 08:46:39	phantom	there probably is
2014-12-02 08:46:40	LaptopBrain	there is opinion
2014-12-02 08:46:40	LaptopBrain	:p
2014-12-02 08:46:41	wartech0	there is just totally wrong answers, wrong answers depending on who you talk to, and mediocre answers
2014-12-02 08:46:48	LaptopBrain	and there is standard practice
2014-12-02 08:47:06	wartech0	The thing I am saying though, there is no right answer
2014-12-02 08:47:19	wartech0	so you won't find that :P
2014-12-02 08:47:32	LaptopBrain	:P
2014-12-02 08:47:56	wartech0	I would say just implement what works
2014-12-02 08:48:01	wartech0	if it works who cares
2014-12-02 08:48:04	LaptopBrain	phantom would have an aneurism if he ever saw my code anyhow.
2014-12-02 08:48:08	phantom	there probably is a right answer... unfortunately most people are shit at code design so the right will get drowned out under a wave of wrong answers vomited out by the masses
2014-12-02 08:48:21	LaptopBrain	there arent many games where every model is built from scaled and transformed cubes.
2014-12-02 08:48:24	wartech0	If it gets to the point where its not maintainable then get it to a point where it is maintainable
2014-12-02 08:48:29	phantom	LaptopBrain: I assume all code is shit until proven otherwise...
2014-12-02 08:48:40	phantom	.. I have yet to be proven otherwise.
2014-12-02 08:49:03	LaptopBrain	phantom: general rule of thumb, code correctness is in the eye of the beholder. every developer wants to rewrite other peoples code to what /they/ think is correct
2014-12-02 08:49:07	wartech0	Well phantom if you have such a rock solid grasp on proper implementation
2014-12-02 08:49:14	wartech0	why don't you share that knowledge with us
2014-12-02 08:49:29	phantom	see previous 'cant be arsed' statement... 
2014-12-02 08:49:32	LaptopBrain	because he'd be here all week :D
2014-12-02 08:50:23	wartech0	but your guidance could make it so you don't see shit implementations everywhere
2014-12-02 08:50:38	LaptopBrain	the problem is
2014-12-02 08:50:46	LaptopBrain	the ideal solution changes each week
2014-12-02 08:51:09	LaptopBrain	if you'd asked a developer ten years ago how you write a game, it would be "big plan up front, massive design doc, don't waver from the spec"
2014-12-02 08:51:39	@MikeP	only if you asked a shitty developer
2014-12-02 08:51:42	LaptopBrain	now i bet if you ask most developers, they'll be all agile methodology, flexible designs, etc
2014-12-02 08:51:50	@MikeP	only if you asked a shitty developer
2014-12-02 08:52:01	LaptopBrain	what i'm saying is, what's acceptable in software dev changes often
2014-12-02 08:52:16	LaptopBrain	and if advice is given, someone tends to write it down and turn it into sitty tutorials which rapidly become outdated
2014-12-02 08:52:26	LaptopBrain	so its a losing battle
2014-12-02 08:52:38	LaptopBrain	the only way to write good code is to stay informed
2014-12-02 08:52:39	LaptopBrain	iirc
2014-12-02 08:52:44	LaptopBrain	:p
2014-12-02 08:52:45	wartech0	I would say the 3 bigger ones are re-usability, consistency, and malleability would be the 3 big major factors to decent design
2014-12-02 08:52:59	LaptopBrain	re-usability isnt always in my top three
2014-12-02 08:53:12	LaptopBrain	i write a lot of code with the intention of never running it again once its been executed once (one-off conversion scripts etc)
2014-12-02 08:53:15	wartech0	It is for me, because I don't like doing work over and over again :P
2014-12-02 08:53:39	LaptopBrain	in fact at work i have a whole folder full of obsolete one-off programs
2014-12-02 08:54:01	LaptopBrain	it was still quicker to produce that program than to do the job by hand, but i'll never run that program again
2014-12-02 08:54:33	wartech0	but you see there is likely things you solved going through that program that you may need in the future
2014-12-02 08:54:38	wartech0	I run into that problem all the time
2014-12-02 08:54:55	wartech0	just last week my friend was like "how do I do destructible terrain"
2014-12-02 08:55:15	wartech0	now if I would have written my marching squares implementation in a way that could have been reused
2014-12-02 08:55:23	wartech0	he would have just been able to use my implementation, but I didn't
2014-12-02 08:55:25	phantom	"what if" and "might need" are not valid design concerns.... design for the fucking problem you have not some imagined distant problem in the future... otherwise you'll produce shit
2014-12-02 08:55:29	wartech0	and I am kicking myself for it now

2014-12-02 09:01:52	LaptopBrain	on the note of reusability
2014-12-02 09:02:01	LaptopBrain	often i'll write a nicely documented way of doing something (non-gamedev)
2014-12-02 09:02:11	LaptopBrain	and some other guy comes along and goes "well i would rather do it my way"
2014-12-02 09:02:40	@zao	"good for you, laddy"
2014-12-02 09:02:48	LaptopBrain	so you have a well designed secure database abstraction layer, specially made to suit a particular need, and someone just comes along and establishes a dbo connection within your system
2014-12-02 09:02:51	LaptopBrain	and you're like GRR.
2014-12-02 09:03:08	LaptopBrain	then when they get stuck because it can't work right on the system.... well... who do they turn to

2014-12-02 09:16:23	wartech0	due to cold weather
2014-12-02 09:16:42	wartech0	I work as a manager at walgreens
2014-12-02 09:17:47	@zao	Level up!
2014-12-02 09:18:26	@KnightTemplar	wartech0: apply for the ATC open hiring in February
2014-12-02 09:18:36	mikeman	what's better? Toys or drugs? :P
2014-12-02 09:18:41	wartech0	BOTH
2014-12-02 09:19:31	wartech0	I actually had to go up to the KBI to get my finger prints taken so I could work in the pharmacy
2014-12-02 09:22:18	@MikeP	my brother works at a walgreens
2014-12-02 09:22:24	@MikeP	he's in high school
2014-12-02 09:22:31	Sirisian|Work	As a manager?
2014-12-02 09:22:40	wartech0	not likely
2014-12-02 09:23:05	wartech0	being a manager you have to do alcohol sales, and to do them you have to be 21
2014-12-02 09:23:12	@MikeP	heh, "managers" there aren't much more useful than anyone else
2014-12-02 09:23:21	Sirisian|Work	I remember when I worked at a grocery store. One of my managers was a kid with an English masters. Very well spoken.
2014-12-02 09:23:41	wartech0	meh, we pull money from drawers, count the safe, do cash pickups
2014-12-02 09:23:41	@MikeP	it's just a title they give to people so that they'll be marginally more likely to accept shit pay and not to steal shit from them
2014-12-02 09:23:54	wartech0	yea pretty much :P
2014-12-02 09:24:01	Sirisian|Work	But the power! :P
2014-12-02 09:24:04	wartech0	I don't get paid terribly though
2014-12-02 09:24:12	wartech0	I mean its bad but its not as bad as toys r us
2014-12-02 09:24:18	wartech0	its double what I was making there
2014-12-02 09:24:28	@MikeP	well that's something at least
2014-12-02 09:24:30	Sirisian|Work	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P_AnvUIvJs
2014-12-02 09:24:36	wartech0	and actually walgreens as a company pays even cashiers a bit better
2014-12-02 09:24:45	wartech0	some cashiers there make 9USD an hour
2014-12-02 09:24:56	wartech0	which is kinda unheard of as far as around here goes

2014-12-02 09:25:30	wartech0	MikeP, see that isn't too bad
2014-12-02 09:25:38	wartech0	does it outweigh the cost of living though?
2014-12-02 09:25:43	@KnightTemplar	MikeP: So you're worth 10 of your brother?
2014-12-02 09:26:24	Roy_Fokker	12$/hr is pitiful
2014-12-02 09:26:27	Sirisian|Work	I made 10.50 in HS stocking shelves. Still probably one of the easiest jobs I've ever had.
2014-12-02 09:26:33	Roy_Fokker	MikeP: why so low
2014-12-02 09:26:42	@MikeP	he's working at a *walgreens*
2014-12-02 09:26:49	Roy_Fokker	ah

2014-12-02 09:27:12	wartech0	well he did say he was in highschool
2014-12-02 09:27:13	wartech0	yea
2014-12-02 09:27:22	Roy_Fokker	Sirisian|Work: made more counting stock on the shelves
2014-12-02 09:27:29	Roy_Fokker	didn't even have to do much, just count
2014-12-02 09:27:30	wartech0	for a highschooler 12 bucks an hour is great
2014-12-02 09:27:37	Roy_Fokker	easiest job i've ever done
2014-12-02 09:27:59	wartech0	my job is easy until the safe goes low
2014-12-02 09:28:01	wartech0	or high
2014-12-02 09:28:07	Sirisian|Work	Roy_Fokker, that doesn't make sense. Doesn't the computer do that?

2014-12-02 09:28:42	Roy_Fokker	which is why they have companies that count manually
2014-12-02 09:28:47	wartech0	MikeP yea, but so does toys r us
2014-12-02 09:28:55	wartech0	and at least at walgreens you get holiday pay
2014-12-02 09:29:01	wartech0	for the days you do work on holiday
2014-12-02 09:29:11	wartech0	some differential I believe
2014-12-02 09:29:19	wartech0	idk, haven't had to work a holiday yet

2014-12-02 09:29:47	wartech0	so there is ATC open hiring?

2014-12-02 09:32:17	@MikeP	two things I don't want to go near
2014-12-02 09:32:18	@KnightTemplar	One of the nicest hubs in the country
2014-12-02 09:32:25	@KnightTemplar	Way nicer than Newark or Lagarbage
2014-12-02 09:32:31	@MikeP	but why the fuck would I go near detroit?
2014-12-02 09:32:35	phantom	Detroit? Why would anyone go there? Isn't that a wasteland now? With mutants wandering about the place...?
2014-12-02 09:32:35	@MikeP	there's nothing there
2014-12-02 09:32:46	@KnightTemplar	MikeP: Not to, through
2014-12-02 09:32:53	phantom	wait... I'm thinking of Fallout aren't I?
2014-12-02 09:32:55	@MikeP	why would I go *through* there either?
2014-12-02 09:32:57	@KnightTemplar	phantom: We have one of the top orchestras in America :)
2014-12-02 09:33:08	@KnightTemplar	MikeP: Because Delta connects to almost everywhere from Detroit
2014-12-02 09:33:16	@KnightTemplar	we're Delta's second biggest hub
2014-12-02 09:33:16	phantom	KnightTemplar: because they accidently came in once and now no one will let them leave? <_<
2014-12-02 09:33:19	@MikeP	why would I fly delta? and why would I not get direct flights? :D
2014-12-02 09:33:32	@KnightTemplar	*shrug*
2014-12-02 09:33:40	@MikeP	direct flights ftw
2014-12-02 09:33:44	@KnightTemplar	You'd fly Delta because they're the best legacy carrier

2014-12-02 09:36:19	Sirisian|Work	I'd be fine if they removed the windows on their planes personally to cust costs or removed seating.

2014-12-02 09:36:42	@KnightTemplar	Sirisian|Work: Removed seating? That would mean fewer people so it would cost more

2014-12-02 09:41:09	@KnightTemplar	Have you ever heard of a plane crashing due to a window failure?
2014-12-02 09:41:32	@zao	Sirisian|Work: Cow-orker had a comparison that returned {0 on equality, otherwise a>b}
2014-12-02 09:41:59	@zao	(where intended code is strcmp-ish with -1, 0, 1)
2014-12-02 09:42:16	Shadowdancer	KnightTemplar: no, but since when would a window on a pressure vessel not be a structural disadvantage?
2014-12-02 09:42:53	Sirisian|Work	zao, that function has a defined method in the spec. It's the same across all browsers I believe.
2014-12-02 09:42:54	@KnightTemplar	Shadowdancer: The plane's fuselage isn't one entire unit anyways
2014-12-02 09:42:54	wartech0	I am sure those windows are exceptionally strong

2014-12-02 09:43:41	@zao	Sirisian|Work: Firefox manages to produce an unicodibetical sort. Chrome and IE yields kind-of-sorted output.
2014-12-02 09:43:49	Sirisian|Work	oh wait there isn't one.
2014-12-02 09:44:05	@KnightTemplar	Shadowdancer: Sure it might be "safer" in the same theoretical sense, but do you wear a hardhat everywhere? :P
2014-12-02 09:44:32	Shadowdancer	no, but still, windowless planes would make sense in that regard, even if it's only statistical
2014-12-02 09:44:46	Shadowdancer	I've never needed my airbag either
2014-12-02 09:44:48	@KnightTemplar	It's not statistical, because there's no evidence that a window failure has ever caused a crash :P
2014-12-02 09:44:50	Sirisian|Work	"If compareFunction is not supplied, elements are sorted by converting them to strings and comparing strings in Unicode code point order. For example, "Cherry" comes before "banana"."

2014-12-02 09:45:58	Shadowdancer	KnightTemplar: assuming that windows made structural or economical sense, how come freight planes don't have them, or even have them "boarded up" in conversion then?
2014-12-02 09:46:06	wartech0	I can see the point of losing cabin pressure being very very bad for structural integrity

2014-12-02 10:38:52	Sargon	basehead: What's the issue?
2014-12-02 10:38:58	basehead	so far im thinking something like using the 2 corners of the base of the tight bounding box.. getting the terrain height at those 2 corners, calcing the slope from that stuff, then the arctan of that
2014-12-02 10:39:20	basehead	and do that for each axis
2014-12-02 10:39:36	basehead	doesnt seem to be working though, there's random times on flat ground where the rotation just swings wildly
2014-12-02 10:40:26	basehead	this is so like a character running on an incline rotates properly etc
2014-12-02 10:40:52	Sargon	basehead: http://pompidev.net/2014/06/08/simple-truck-racing-physicspart-1/

2014-12-02 10:43:19	basehead	zao: for something as narrow as a person you can probably just use the normal at the exact coordinate, but what about creatures like a dinosaur with a long bounding box etc.
2014-12-02 10:43:28	Sargon	So maybe your terrain is not a "closed surface"
2014-12-02 10:43:33	basehead	it is
2014-12-02 10:44:13	Sargon	Then what is the issue youa er having?

2014-12-02 10:45:24	basehead	yeah well.. i'm still working on it
2014-12-02 10:45:27	Sargon	And of what
2014-12-02 10:45:30	Sirisian|Work	I'd look at how WoW handles it right now probably. I'm imagining WoW is fairly buggy with slopes though and large creatures. I'm imagining it it's all done around the center of mass then try to make the feet touch the ground through IK.
2014-12-02 10:45:41	DeM0nFiRe	Dinosaurs are well known to have been unable to stand on slopes for precisely the problem you describe (I probably made some or all of that up)
2014-12-02 10:45:42	basehead	i'll just be walking along and the X or Z will swing all the way around
2014-12-02 10:45:52	basehead	on a flat surface or nearly flat
2014-12-02 10:45:56	Sargon	basehead: I have more "advanced" physics in the same website
2014-12-02 10:46:03	basehead	but im pretty sure arctan is correct
2014-12-02 10:46:25	Sargon	basehead: My guess you get some sort of gimbel look or divide by near zero but I am not sure
2014-12-02 10:46:31	basehead	possible

2014-12-02 10:50:09	Sargon	basehead: Do you cast a ray from far above the character or just above the terrain?
2014-12-02 10:50:13	basehead	well looking isn't really the issue, it's the math of how its done
2014-12-02 10:52:05	Sirisian|Work	basehead, are you sure IK is done?

2014-12-02 14:30:18	DeM0nFiRe	Well, the multiplayer will be through steamworks, not GFWL
2014-12-02 14:30:33	DeM0nFiRe	I don't play multiplayer now, because I don't have and don't want a GFWL account

2014-12-02 14:37:06	Promit	but now i can use hotmail
2014-12-02 14:37:19	Promit	i didn't do anything

2014-12-02 14:39:43	@ibutsu	could be, it gets a little muddled with acquisitions and whatnot. I have a regular skype account, but I can also log in using my live account as well, though they aren't linked in any way. My hotmail account pre-dated MS's purchase and it was converted to a live account.
2014-12-02 14:40:33	Promit	yeah my skype account and my MS account got linked, and then got used as my sign in for windows 8
2014-12-02 14:40:40	Promit	and then i was getting skype messages delivered to my desktop
2014-12-02 14:40:46	Promit	which is fucking obnoxious
2014-12-02 14:40:57	Sirisian|Work	I know my skype account got really confused when MS bought them since I used the same email already. It bugged out and asked me to link them then failed to do that and had me in like a ghost account that didn't let me do anything until I unlinked it and tried again. So confusing.
2014-12-02 14:41:10	@ibutsu	Sirisian|Work: yeah, using the same account for both GFWL and Xbox makes for weirdness in the recent apps list since your GFWL games will be populated into it on the xbox

2014-12-02 18:49:48	Promit	i didn't see the k240s at work but i should check again
2014-12-02 18:50:12	Promit	i find the bass on the 280 pro and the k240 both to be a little too subdued
2014-12-02 18:50:21	Promit	and a little boomy on the SE215
2014-12-02 18:50:31	@KnightTemplar	I often listen to music with both headphones and monitors :)

2014-12-02 19:01:06	@KnightTemplar	oh, you want the low C?

2014-12-02 19:01:22	Promit	i might set both up in A, i remain undecided

2014-12-02 20:21:37	wartech0	otherwise she is just lawful evil
2014-12-02 20:21:39	wartech0	oh
2014-12-02 20:22:08	wartech0	well to be the devils advocate maybe the DM was like "babe... I WANT YOU TO PLAY"
2014-12-02 20:22:10	DeM0nFiRe	These steam cards are really fucking annoying
2014-12-02 20:22:12	wartech0	and she is like "No..."
2014-12-02 20:22:17	wartech0	DeM0nFiRe, I know right
2014-12-02 20:22:39	QuantumP7	Hmm. Temple Run is comsidered 3D, right?

2014-12-02 20:23:31	ace4016	Roy_Fokker, forcing the gf to play seems like a bad idea (tm)
2014-12-02 20:23:44	QuantumP7	Ok, thanks!
2014-12-02 20:23:45	Roy_Fokker	no one forced her to play
2014-12-02 20:24:00	Roy_Fokker	she forced him to let her play with us
2014-12-02 20:24:08	ace4016	ah...
2014-12-02 20:24:11	Rotaerk	she raped him?
2014-12-02 20:24:15	Rotaerk	err
2014-12-02 20:24:21	ace4016	why didn't she want to help in fights?
2014-12-02 20:24:33	Roy_Fokker	she felt that him doing things without her was "lacking in affection"
2014-12-02 20:24:43	ace4016	lol
2014-12-02 20:24:45	Roy_Fokker	ace4016, i donno

2014-12-02 20:44:26	wartech0	I am all out of hotdog buns
2014-12-02 20:44:36	Roy_Fokker	wrap them in bacon
2014-12-02 20:45:04	wartech0	WHY IS IT, that they put 6 hotdog buns in a package, when hotdogs come in packs of 8
2014-12-02 20:45:04	Rotaerk	wrap them in more hot dogs
2014-12-02 20:45:11	wartech0	IS THIS SOME CRUEL JOKE?!

2014-12-02 20:45:43	Roy_Fokker	in case you burn one or two

2014-12-02 20:49:58	wartech0	Roy_Fokker, I will have to stoop to the level of using wonder bread for hotdog buns
2014-12-02 20:50:03	wartech0	and once again the world has wronged me
2014-12-02 20:50:15	Roy_Fokker	tragedy has indeed struck you
2014-12-02 20:50:19	wartech0	but they can laugh now
2014-12-02 20:50:26	wartech0	my nukes will come 8 to a pack
2014-12-02 20:50:48	wartech0	on a slightly less crazy note, I think I have the answer
2014-12-02 20:50:53	wartech0	its the bun makers fault
2014-12-02 20:51:05	wartech0	because hotdogs actually come 10 to a pack and they are each 1 pound
2014-12-02 20:51:13	wartech0	if they are bigger they will come 8 to a pack and be 1 pound
2014-12-02 20:51:17	wartech0	fairly logical
2014-12-02 20:51:28	wartech0	but the bun makers, they said they just hate 10's
2014-12-02 20:51:33	wartech0	wtf is wrong with 10
2014-12-02 20:52:09	Roy_Fokker	they should have gone with Dozen
2014-12-02 20:52:18	Roy_Fokker	bakers should have taken dozen
2014-12-02 20:54:57	Sirisian	Bakers dozen implies they suck at their job.
2014-12-02 20:55:20	Roy_Fokker	more that they suck at counting
2014-12-02 20:55:23	Sirisian	"How many did you make. You probably had to make your profession's dozen because you made a mistake."
2014-12-02 20:55:26	Sirisian	really?

2014-12-02 20:56:03	Sirisian	"The "baker's dozen" may have originated as a way for bakers to avoid being blamed for shorting their customers."
2014-12-02 20:56:35	Sirisian	"I can't count past 10. How do I know you're not shorting me." "I'll add one more." "okay... that seems fair."
2014-12-02 20:56:47	ace4016	i thought it was so that they can try their batch without having an uneven amount
2014-12-02 20:56:56	Sirisian	yeah exactly ^
2014-12-02 20:56:59	Sirisian	that's my thinking

2014-12-02 20:58:43	Sirisian	Arby's isn't fat. I get two chicken bacon and swiss sandwiches without fries.

2014-12-02 21:02:23	wartech0	I don't give a fuck
2014-12-02 21:02:24	Roy_Fokker	Sirisian, just add pepper
2014-12-02 21:02:29	wartech0	*coughs and dies*
2014-12-02 21:02:40	Rotaerk	the concept that "processed" foods are bad for you doesn't make sense; the term is way too vague
2014-12-02 21:02:48	Rotaerk	certain kinds of processing certainly can be
2014-12-02 21:02:53	wartech0	what I think he means
2014-12-02 21:03:00	wartech0	is foods with a shit load of perservatives
2014-12-02 21:03:10	wartech0	which lets face it
2014-12-02 21:03:14	wartech0	is most processed food
2014-12-02 21:03:16	Rotaerk	salt is a preservative and it's an essential nutrient
2014-12-02 21:03:19	wartech0	(for longer shelf lifes)
2014-12-02 21:03:28	wartech0	Rotaerk, salt is also bad in excess
2014-12-02 21:03:38	Rotaerk	everything's bad in excess
2014-12-02 21:03:42	Roy_Fokker	Sirisian, ask them to use KCl
2014-12-02 21:03:45	Rotaerk	I don't buy the notion that preservative automatically implies "bad"
2014-12-02 21:03:47	Sirisian	I love black pepper. So like a while back my dad asked me how I made hamburgers and I was like "I put some special black salt seasoning on it" "go look at what it's called." and I picked it up on my counter and read it "Something called black pepper. oh it's just black pepper" "good god son, you better find someone to take care of you."
2014-12-02 21:04:04	Rotaerk	some chemicals that can be used as preservatives can be bad for you of course
2014-12-02 21:04:20	Roy_Fokker	Sirisian, clearly he knows you are not capable
2014-12-02 21:04:20	Sirisian	Roy_Fokker, potassium chloride?
2014-12-02 21:04:24	Roy_Fokker	yes
2014-12-02 21:04:31	wartech0	idk people always say "blah blah this causes cancer"
2014-12-02 21:04:33	wartech0	blah blah blah
2014-12-02 21:04:33	Roy_Fokker	it's a NaCl substitute
2014-12-02 21:04:34	Sirisian	NaCl for me thank you.
2014-12-02 21:04:35	wartech0	etc
2014-12-02 21:04:50	wartech0	Sirisian, how about just some Cl?
2014-12-02 21:04:57	wartech0	or just some Na?
2014-12-02 21:05:09	Sirisian	bleach and chlorine is how I clean my bathroom. It's fine.
2014-12-02 21:05:13	Rotaerk	I prefer to preserve my food with bath salts
2014-12-02 21:05:18	Rotaerk	mmmm brains
2014-12-02 21:05:28	wartech0	"poured Na on my meal and the fucker burst into flames"
2014-12-02 21:06:10	Rotaerk	no, Na is bad for you, so go with the Cl approach
2014-12-02 21:06:13	Sirisian	Seriously though apart from the healthy bar food I eat I probably have a horrible diet. I'm actually eating donuts right now.
2014-12-02 21:06:36	Rotaerk	has your metabolism started slowing yet?
2014-12-02 21:06:43	Sirisian	It doesn't in my family.
2014-12-02 21:06:46	wartech0	Mine hasn't
2014-12-02 21:06:48	wartech0	I am 25
2014-12-02 21:06:57	wartech0	and yea same, family is all thin
2014-12-02 21:07:10	wartech0	although you should watch your cholesterol though bro
2014-12-02 21:07:21	Sirisian	High metabolism is something I'll have my whole life. I ate a whole bag of bbq chips last night.
2014-12-02 21:07:23	wartech0	doesn't mean you can't be fucked by a heart attack and or stroke
2014-12-02 21:07:32	Sirisian	and half a bag of pretzels.
2014-12-02 21:07:44	@KnightTemplar	That's healthy
2014-12-02 21:07:47	Sirisian	yes. Heart attacks run in my family.
2014-12-02 21:07:57	wartech0	then you really need to chill :P
2014-12-02 21:08:03	Sirisian	Only one side though.
2014-12-02 21:08:13	Slade	Sirisian, i'm a fan of bagged popcorn and various types of drupes
2014-12-02 21:08:18	Sirisian	I have an irregular heartbeat which is kind of fun also.
2014-12-02 21:08:23	@KnightTemplar	ooooh... Breach & Clear $3.74 on Steam
2014-12-02 21:08:32	Slade	not sure what that does to my cholesterol
2014-12-02 21:08:34	Sirisian	If you listen to my heart it beats differently than normal I guess.
2014-12-02 21:08:35	wartech0	breach and clear... hmm
2014-12-02 21:08:40	wartech0	is that the swat game?
2014-12-02 21:08:45	wartech0	I think I know the guy who made that
2014-12-02 21:08:47	@KnightTemplar	ya
2014-12-02 21:08:57	Sirisian	KnightTemplar, Red Faction Geurilla 2.99
2014-12-02 21:08:58	@KnightTemplar	Not Doorkickers tho'
2014-12-02 21:09:02	@KnightTemplar	Sirisian: cool
2014-12-02 21:09:07	wartech0	I tried to get him to give me a copy
2014-12-02 21:09:10	wartech0	he said no :(
2014-12-02 21:09:12	Sirisian	It's updated to Steam Edition today.
2014-12-02 21:09:18	Sirisian	tons of new features.
2014-12-02 21:09:20	wartech0	oh nope
2014-12-02 21:09:23	wartech0	this isn't the same
2014-12-02 21:09:33	Sirisian	I just installed it actually 2 GBs left to download.
2014-12-02 21:09:44	@KnightTemplar	Sirisian: Is one of the new features "is not red faction"?
2014-12-02 21:09:54	@KnightTemplar	I don't play FPSes
2014-12-02 21:10:29	Sirisian	It's not really an FPS. It's a third person game. It's heavy on melee combat also and planning.
2014-12-02 21:10:49	Sirisian	It's nothing like red faction 1 or 2 or armageddon
2014-12-02 21:10:54	wartech0	they fucked up by not allowing terrain to be destructible
2014-12-02 21:11:01	Sirisian	:\
2014-12-02 21:11:07	wartech0	I remember on Red Faction, you could tunnel to the next level
2014-12-02 21:11:14	wartech0	thats fucking cool

2014-12-02 21:25:06	Sirisian	Okay so you know how war can bolster economies. People are asking if russia might go to war to increase their's like WW2 did for many countries.
2014-12-02 21:25:29	Sirisian	We should totally do fake wars. The economy won't know the difference. Drive out to a place where it can't see us and then just blow up tanks and stuff.
2014-12-02 21:25:43	wartech0	in this day and age war doesn't bolster economies
2014-12-02 21:25:45	wartech0	in fact
2014-12-02 21:25:47	wartech0	it hurts them
2014-12-02 21:26:41	wartech0	going to war with the wrong people puts you into a state of isolationism
2014-12-02 21:26:57	wartech0	thus you have no say in the global economy that is a very real fact these days
2014-12-02 21:27:22	wartech0	so unless you have the material resources to produce everything you need (you don't) you are extremely fucked
2014-12-02 21:29:05	wartech0	its better to just place nice and be a part of the global economy
2014-12-02 21:29:11	Sirisian	It was a joke.
2014-12-02 21:29:11	amitp	let's go to war with drugs, poverty, terror, graffiti, cars, christmas, gangs, cancer, and javascript
2014-12-02 21:29:24	Sirisian	Not Javascript. :(

2014-12-02 22:21:01	Slade	so is it inappropriate to tell a telemarketter that i'm on the toilet and if she sold exlax. i'd buy a ton of it right now?
2014-12-02 22:21:08	Mushu	Slade: no
2014-12-02 22:21:22	Mushu	Slade: telemarketters can burn in the 4th circle of hell for all I care

2014-12-02 22:21:41	Slade	Mushu, even if it isnt true? (i was sitting at a resturant)
2014-12-02 22:21:44	Mushu	I... I guess.
2014-12-02 22:21:59	Slade	KnightTemplar, i'd hope so. it'd be weird to send robots to hell
2014-12-02 22:22:01	@KnightTemplar	I'm not saying you need to buy what they sell, but it doesn't cost anything to be nice :)
2014-12-02 22:22:16	Mushu	Slade: unless you're eating alone, it's rude to answer your phone at a resturant if it's a number you don't know :|
2014-12-02 22:22:33	Mushu	I may be a bit biased.
2014-12-02 22:22:48	Slade	Mushu, it was a number i didnt know, but i was expecting a phone call from that area code, or i woulda ignored it..  and yes i was eating alone
2014-12-02 22:22:49	Mushu	KnightTemplar: I have a cool number, and as the cost I get called often by debt collectors looking for someone who's not me
2014-12-02 22:23:00	Mushu	KnightTemplar: And they want my social etc to confirm that I am not who they're looking for (lol)

2014-12-02 22:23:16	Mushu	So at first I got a lot of spam calls.
2014-12-02 22:23:19	Mushu	KnightTemplar: I just hang up.
2014-12-02 22:23:25	Mushu	And keep my voicemail full.
2014-12-02 22:23:38	Mushu	They're debt collectors, they're unrelenting.
2014-12-02 22:23:59	Mushu	Anyway, I am very biased.
2014-12-02 22:24:16	Mushu	Slade: if you're eating alone it's whatever.
2014-12-02 22:24:21	Mushu	Slade: I'd probably have done the same thing.
2014-12-02 22:24:46	ace4016	i keep getting calls from florida...tons of telemarketers down there
2014-12-02 22:24:52	Mushu	I have a 'zdontanswer' entry on my contacts list where I put the numbers of all undesirables, so I can tell at a glance if they're not someone I want to answer
2014-12-02 22:24:57	Mushu	(the 'z' is so that it's last in the contact list)

2014-12-02 22:27:21	Mushu	ace4016: also, as an added bonus, robocall software seems to recognize "inbox full" for some reason

2014-12-03 03:44:20	Mushu	zao: If you're using client certs, it *might* break something. The client CA list is used by the client to determine which of its certs to use to authenticate with.
2014-12-03 03:44:33	Mushu	zao: It *can* work without the CA list, but the client may not know which cert to send if it has multiple

2014-12-03 03:46:00	Mushu	Yeah, the Certificate Request should be the bulky part, since it contains a list of X.509 CAs the server will accept client certificates signed by.
2014-12-03 03:46:09	sinclair	zao: how does thou do mutual exclusion locking on mysql records?
2014-12-03 03:46:20	Mushu	"If the certificate_authorities list is empty, then the client MAY send any certificate of the appropriate ClientCertificateType"
2014-12-03 03:46:23	@zao	Certificate is 4746, Certificate Request is 9285.
2014-12-03 03:46:40	Mushu	So there's no flag, you can just send an empty list and leave the client to figure it out.

2014-12-03 03:51:02	Shadowdancer	or maybe the weird machine fucks up routing by being a DHCP server and a really bad forwarder
2014-12-03 03:51:04	sinclair	zao: as the read, and update are in a transaction (a global serialized one), that should ensure that any request to lock, (the stored proc is named lock_record), i should only ever be hit once

2014-12-03 06:45:03	sinclair	zao: remember how i said i needed to treat the filesystem as a database?
2014-12-03 06:45:17	@zao	Vaguely.
2014-12-03 06:46:10	sinclair	zao: well, i went ahead and did that, i write files in place, it was all g, i created a .meta directory (hidden folder) and i write access logging in there (append only)
2014-12-03 06:46:31	sinclair	i had run into the same issue as to whether or not to use json for that
2014-12-03 06:46:34	sinclair	i opted not to
2014-12-03 06:47:05	sinclair	instead, i opted for a flat file, newline delimited thing instead, which worked out well enough
2014-12-03 06:47:44	sinclair	i also added forward and reverse line readers into it so i could scan across the file pretty quick (not sure if that is a requirement for you)
2014-12-03 06:47:55	sinclair	the issue with json is that you need to load up the entire document
2014-12-03 06:48:14	sinclair	i found scanning across some flat file a lot simpler in the end

2014-12-03 07:41:22	phantom	depends on what I'm doing... in game, right now, probably Lua simply because it is light, easy to embed and extend and generally reasonably fast...

2014-12-03 07:41:42	sinclair	phantom: i didn't know people still bothered with Lua
2014-12-03 07:41:48	@zao	mantis: Didn't we agree that Points was one of those "probably not there, lol" fields, much like your "Vertices"?]
2014-12-03 07:42:06	phantom	sinclair: in games, yeah, it's still A Thing in some places... because of reasons above
2014-12-03 07:42:08	@zao	It's an arrow, just synthesise the shape like with rectangles and lines.
2014-12-03 07:42:18	@zao	Unit arrow, flip and mirror and scale.
2014-12-03 07:42:25	sinclair	phantom: hmmm, i guess where i make a call is id trade off a bit of perf for the ability to hire language X devs off the street
2014-12-03 07:42:27	mantis	the problem is, arrow is adjustable
2014-12-03 07:42:41	sinclair	phantom: i don't know any Lua devs, i know plenty of JS heads
2014-12-03 07:42:42	mantis	it has control points
2014-12-03 07:42:49	mantis	that are not shown in the code as well
2014-12-03 07:43:00	mikeman	"lua devs"
2014-12-03 07:43:04	mantis	and nodes are basically vertices for drawing
2014-12-03 07:43:06	mikeman	you can learn lua in, like, two days
2014-12-03 07:43:15	sinclair	mikeman: only if you're a pro
2014-12-03 07:43:32	phantom	sinclair: yes, because you do crazy bullshit web things... only person I know who touches js on a day-to-day basis hates the language and all the bullshit html5 bollocks that goes will it and wants to get the fuck away from it asap
2014-12-03 07:43:45	@zao	mantis: The act of editing an arrow turns it into something that has Points.
2014-12-03 07:43:46	mantis	you'll notice that amount of nodes in arrow is equal to its vertices + 1 (for the return trip from last point to first)
2014-12-03 07:43:50	sinclair	phantom: html5?
2014-12-03 07:43:57	mantis	zao: only if you edit it by vertices
2014-12-03 07:44:03	sinclair	phantom: html is shit mate, don't use that
2014-12-03 07:44:08	mantis	not if you edit by control points I think
2014-12-03 07:44:10	@zao	Well, how do _you_ edit it if not "Edit shape"?
2014-12-03 07:44:17	@zao	Speak out of your beard.
2014-12-03 07:44:23	mikeman	sinclair: right, an intermediate would take 4 days
2014-12-03 07:44:40	mantis	zao: select arrow, yellow points appear on outline
2014-12-03 07:44:47	sinclair	mikeman: i have a hard enough time finding intermediates nowadays
2014-12-03 07:44:56	mantis	two to be precise
2014-12-03 07:44:59	mantis	them be control points
2014-12-03 07:45:03	@zao	Ah.
2014-12-03 07:45:12	mantis	and yes, I noticed that 'edit shape' turns it into freeform
2014-12-03 07:45:29	mikeman	so you want to hire any moron that has "JS dev" in his resume, even if he can't learn shit
2014-12-03 07:45:34	mantis	(once you edit shape, it loses all data about being arrow)
2014-12-03 07:45:53	mantis	when you edit control points, it's still an arrow
2014-12-03 07:45:56	phantom	sinclair: yes, because choices of what to use when targeting web browsers are so numerous these days... oh, no, wait, it's the collective clusterfuck which is "html5 technology".. or... pretty much nowt...
2014-12-03 07:46:04	sinclair	mikeman: no, he has to learn something, that something is typescript
2014-12-03 07:46:10	sinclair	sorry, "they"
2014-12-03 07:46:17	sinclair	it might be some chick afterall
2014-12-03 07:46:20	sinclair	<_<
2014-12-03 07:46:33	mikeman	alright, enough with the language evangelism for one day
2014-12-03 07:46:34	mantis	ergo, if there is no property for 'control points' (and I didn't find one), it has to be UI thing, which means that 'Points' should work properly
2014-12-03 07:46:48	mantis	that's my reasoning at least
2014-12-03 07:47:05	sinclair	mikeman: i win this round, because...

2014-12-03 07:49:53	phantom	hell, he is lucky I didn't kick him for not calling Lua by its proper name.. <_<
2014-12-03 07:50:52	mikeman	it would be funny if Ass0 was here and they started arguing

2014-12-03 07:54:08	sinclair	Roy_Fokker: are you sure you aint Ra ?
2014-12-03 07:54:46	phantom	yes, because those two are so alike...

2014-12-03 08:13:27	Shadowdancer	there's no story (although there's supposed to be some kind of "event" starting with release where you get to do missions and shit), so it can get old rather quickly

2014-12-03 08:44:17	@MikeP	excellent comment
2014-12-03 08:44:17	@zao	Nothing says "I know what I'm doing" like "one allocation per row".
2014-12-03 08:44:40	@MikeP	how hard is it to look up matrix multiplication anyway?
2014-12-03 08:44:55	@MikeP	I estimate 5% of all internet pages are dedicated to explaining matrix and vector math
2014-12-03 08:44:56	@zao	MikeP: But that's all in math language.
2014-12-03 08:45:04	@MikeP	not all of it
2014-12-03 08:45:09	Sirisian	It's interesting looking at things from a beginner's perspective. Beginners do crazy things.
2014-12-03 08:45:15	@MikeP	there's at least one page in each programming language

2014-12-03 08:47:00	@MikeP	there's even a video on how to do it in C and Hindi!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-Z-c8wVUQ
2014-12-03 08:47:09	@zao	But what if they use a different matrix storage convention?
2014-12-03 08:47:18	@zao	Or what if they use the wrong code style?
2014-12-03 08:47:22	@zao	How should you then copy-paste it?

2014-12-03 09:00:32	phantom	eating burgers is only a problem if you cook them in the fat instead of draining it away... and even then I'd argue sugar is a bigger problem then some fatty meat... hell, I ate meat for 2 weeks in the States and lost weight while I was there...

2014-12-03 09:03:00	mantis	Shadowdancer: there are two kinds of cholesterol, LDL and HDL, and you should keep them basically within sensible norms
2014-12-03 09:03:07	mantis	but that's true of everything

2014-12-03 09:03:32	mantis	but yeah, 'this is full of cholesterol' is something idiots said and some idiots repeat
2014-12-03 09:03:34	Sargon	Shadowdancer: Doesn't high cholesterol correlated with your arteries being clogged?
2014-12-03 09:04:03	mantis	Sargon: 2 kinds, etc, depends, etc
2014-12-03 09:04:11	Shadowdancer	Sargon: bad thing is that no correlation was found betwen cholesterol levels in your food and cholesterol levels in your blood
2014-12-03 09:04:26	Shadowdancer	so just eat the f**ing egg!
2014-12-03 09:04:29	mantis	Shadowdancer: that's because we generate OUR OWN cholesterol

2014-12-03 10:23:23	mantis	I assume that they're just hate ridden group, and since hating on black people is not 'kosher' these days, they hate easier target - people from OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY

2014-12-03 11:40:33	Promit	yeah
2014-12-03 11:40:39	%Washu	Well, you found your problem.
2014-12-03 11:42:41	@zao	urraka: In C, extern on the second inherits internal or external linkage from the declaration.
2014-12-03 11:42:56	@zao	urraka: If second lacks extern, it works as if it had extern and the same rules apply.
2014-12-03 11:43:00	@zao	(for functions, all this)
2014-12-03 11:43:54	@zao	Washu: In C++, given a declaration with a static storage specifier and a definition without any storage specifier, which chapter&verse determines the linkage of the function?
2014-12-03 11:44:08	%Washu	zao: probably undefined.
2014-12-03 11:44:14	@zao	In C, it's 6.2.2 according to https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/DCL36-C.+Do+not+declare+an+identifier+with+conflicting+linkage+classifications
2014-12-03 11:44:33	@zao	In C++, I can't really find anything outside of block scope that talks about redeclarations.
2014-12-03 11:44:57	Sirisian|Work	Promit, change the clear color to make sure. :|
2014-12-03 11:45:04	Promit	did that
2014-12-03 11:45:11	%Washu	i'm pretty sure in C++ it inherits it from the decleration
2014-12-03 11:45:28	%Washu	due to member function fuckery (i.e. you don't have to declare static member functions static in the definition)
2014-12-03 11:45:35	@zao	How cute, CERT cites C99 for the C++ diagnostic :)
2014-12-03 11:50:26	%Washu	3.5 - 3 in C++11
2014-12-03 11:50:31	%Washu	appears to be the main one that applies
2014-12-03 11:50:45	%Washu	A name having namespace scope (3.3.6) has internal linkage if it is the name of ? a variable, function or function template that is explicitly declared static; or, ? a variable that is explicitly declared const or constexpr and neither explicitly declared extern nor previously declared to have external linkage; or ? a data member of an anonymous union.
2014-12-03 11:52:06	Promit	i'm still never sure whether i want to make things static or put them in an anon namespace
2014-12-03 11:52:07	%Washu	the key word there being "declared static"
2014-12-03 11:52:15	%Washu	Promit: functionally they're equivelent
2014-12-03 11:53:02	Promit	well they deprecated and then undeprecated static to credate internal linkage, right
2014-12-03 11:53:34	Promit	 anonymous namespace allows external linkage with a unique name, which seems pointless to me
2014-12-03 11:53:39	Promit	and i'm not clear on why it was added as a feature
2014-12-03 11:53:40	mantis	Shadowdancer: no idea if I can make shape closed under HTML5 if I use moveTo instead of lineTo
2014-12-03 11:53:44	mantis	sigh
2014-12-03 11:54:32	%Washu	well, it turns out, Promit 
2014-12-03 11:54:44	%Washu	that anonymous namespaces and static solve two different problems that are nearly identical.
2014-12-03 11:57:07	Sirisian|Work	mantis, Context2d?
2014-12-03 11:57:27	Sirisian|Work	.closePath()
2014-12-03 11:58:11	Promit	i guess there's lots of things that can't be marked static but may need to avoid name collisions
2014-12-03 11:58:16	Promit	identically named classes in different TUs?
2014-12-03 11:58:22	%Washu	sure
2014-12-03 11:59:03	%Washu	You might have a "Node" class that's actually different in two separate source files... ideally you want those to probably be internal linkage, not external
2014-12-03 11:59:36	urraka	zao cool thanks
2014-12-03 11:59:37	mantis	Sirisian|Work: I have complex shit shape, with some internal lines invisible (ie, moveTo instead of lineTo)

2014-12-03 12:02:54	mantis	because so far I'm NOT using moveTo
2014-12-03 12:02:58	mantis	just lineTo
2014-12-03 12:03:03	Sirisian|Work	ah gotcha
2014-12-03 12:03:17	mantis	question is, will it be filling correctly when I do moveTo?
2014-12-03 12:03:36	mantis	because I just pasted how it fills right now :P
2014-12-03 12:03:44	Sirisian|Work	depends on the orientation, but yeah generally
2014-12-03 12:03:56	mantis	cloud, sun, and 'no go' sign are obviously wrong
2014-12-03 12:04:10	Sirisian|Work	Remember it's basically following SVG rules in regards to clockwise fill
2014-12-03 12:04:22	mantis	mkay
2014-12-03 12:04:52	Sirisian|Work	your errors like with the eyes are because of the winding direction
2014-12-03 12:05:06	Sirisian|Work	arc in the opposite direction. (pass false instead of true or whatever)
2014-12-03 12:05:12	mantis	the bigger question is: can I even pull out the 'brushup' lines :|
2014-12-03 12:05:27	mantis	it may be just fucking hardcoded withing Microsoft Interop
2014-12-03 12:05:41	mantis	and in that case, I'd have to render all types on my own, by hand
2014-12-03 12:05:41	Sirisian|Work	fill shouldn't render lines.

2014-12-03 16:14:49	ace4016	mm, it's not really odd.  it's not really ignorant either...sadly
2014-12-03 16:15:01	ace4016	yea, don't really care
2014-12-03 16:17:27	Sirisian|Work	I never realized it increased like 1% a year. Drones are going to be interesting at like 85% efficiency.
2014-12-03 16:17:34	ace4016	pitbulls can be sweet and loving dogs and go thier entire life never hurting an animal or dog...if you train them properly (most people can't train them properly)
2014-12-03 16:17:53	ace4016	drones are going to be just as dull at 85%
2014-12-03 16:18:57	Sirisian|Work	nah they'll use EM drives to push to orbit  and charge then drop in to attack with lasers. It's going to be sweet.
2014-12-03 16:19:12	ace4016	...
2014-12-03 16:19:25	Sirisian|Work	pew pew
2014-12-03 16:19:30	ace4016	you mean the EM drives that have low TWRs?
2014-12-03 16:19:46	ace4016	which is fine in space, but not so much for getting off the earth
2014-12-03 16:19:55	ace4016	don't you play KSP?
2014-12-03 16:20:08	Sirisian|Work	Well this is the future. Anything is possible. 85% is 40+ years away.
2014-12-03 16:20:49	Sirisian|Work	EM drives will probably have linear thrust improvements. Batteries will go up also.
2014-12-03 16:25:26	Shadowdancer	heh physics and linear ^^
2014-12-03 16:25:55	Sirisian|Work	or exponential, but I doubt they'll get exponential improvements.
2014-12-03 16:26:11	Shadowdancer	you're thinking in the wrong way
2014-12-03 16:26:45	Shadowdancer	scaling is rarely above linear where you need it
2014-12-03 16:27:32	Shadowdancer	and there are often theoretical limits that dampen your enthusiasm even before you start building stuff
2014-12-03 16:28:15	Sirisian|Work	Possibly. The efficiency is based on the cavity design though. The ones they're using right now they've admitted are basically naive since the science isn't fully understood. Figuring things out will lead to improvements.
2014-12-03 16:28:22	Shadowdancer	and since it's physics, those limits will be pie in the sky
2014-12-03 16:28:39	Sirisian|Work	Kind of like how solar cells are increasing at a linear rate through new design and better understanding.
2014-12-03 16:29:34	Shadowdancer	that kind of progress often stops abruptly when you run into the limits of technology
2014-12-03 16:29:58	Shadowdancer	extrapolating linearly from that kind of statistic is beyond naive
2014-12-03 16:30:08	Shadowdancer	it's what makes the economy crash every four years
2014-12-03 16:30:37	Sirisian|Work	Technology has no limits though. :|
2014-12-03 16:30:55	Shadowdancer	and once a technology is sucked dry in terms of significant improvements, it needs the holy trinity of skill, luck and funding to go the next step
2014-12-03 16:31:20	Shadowdancer	cf. vacuum tubes
2014-12-03 16:31:27	Sirisian|Work	mosty just funding though. Any problem can be solved wih enough money.
2014-12-03 16:31:31	Shadowdancer	it wasn't a law of nature that someone figured out transistors
2014-12-03 16:32:05	Sirisian|Work	I think bell labs had a basic idea though of what was going to work.

2014-12-03 18:08:02	Sirisian|Work	Slade, An optical computer?
2014-12-03 18:08:38	Sirisian|Work	directing light frequencies down the same wire then pushing them off in their own direction saves space.
2014-12-03 18:09:56	Slade	computer isnt optical. just the interface between components
2014-12-03 18:10:16	Sirisian|Work	Well yet. They made optical transistors already
2014-12-03 18:10:18	Slade	you're thinking it leads to smaller computers?
2014-12-03 18:10:42	Sirisian|Work	Well or different designs.
2014-12-03 18:10:54	Slade	hm ok
2014-12-03 18:11:02	Sirisian|Work	replacing electrons on wire with light pulses might be interesting.
2014-12-03 18:11:09	Slade	why
2014-12-03 18:11:18	Sirisian|Work	less resistance and heat possibly
2014-12-03 18:11:37	@MikeP	you mean like, fiber optics?
2014-12-03 18:12:46	Sirisian|Work	Kind of. Imagining more the fiber optic light entering the router and the headers being read by an optical circuit and it just kind of flows through the device and out.
2014-12-03 18:13:04	Sirisian|Work	(in the correct direction)
2014-12-03 18:13:20	Slade	MikeP, i think the the article hes talking about just removes lots of the infrastructure required for fiber optic translation. not sure tho
2014-12-03 18:13:59	@MikeP	heh, what is an "optical circuit" ?
2014-12-03 18:14:13	@MikeP	hitherto undiscovered physics?

2014-12-03 18:14:17	Sirisian|Work	Well it's just directing certain frequencies in unique directions very accurately. So frequency a, b, c go off left and c goes straight and d goes to the right, etc.
2014-12-03 18:14:35	Sirisian|Work	and also at a nm scale
2014-12-03 18:14:36	@MikeP	I understand the concept of a circuit
2014-12-03 18:14:55	Slade	MikeP, its a nascar thing right?
2014-12-03 18:14:57	Sirisian|Work	I'm just expanding that the article doesn't explicitly say future applications really.
2014-12-03 18:15:30	@MikeP	ah, another of your pop-sci articles. I must have joined just after you linked it
2014-12-03 18:15:48	Sirisian|Work	I mean the article ends vaguely 'The algorithm is the key. It gives researchers a tool to create optical components to perform specific functions, and in many cases such components didn't even exist before. "There's no way to analytically design these kinds of devices," Piggott said.'
2014-12-03 18:16:27	@MikeP	now way to analytically design them? what does that mean, they have to just randomly do shit and hope it magically works?
2014-12-03 18:16:38	@MikeP	s/now/no
2014-12-03 18:17:07	Slade	MikeP, art not science man.
2014-12-03 18:17:17	Sirisian|Work	It required simulation I believe to find the right bars to create the interferrence. They said it ran for 15 minutes on a laptop.

2014-12-03 18:35:36	Slade	MikeP, ah its not just useful for trading options, but predicting movements. to me i'm interested in predicting the unusual option activity done by insider-like trading and filtering out the weirdos about to lose a million dollars

2014-12-03 19:23:53	Sirisian	They should extend trailers to 30 minutes.
2014-12-03 19:24:03	Slade	MikeP, which game was this
2014-12-03 19:24:18	@MikeP	space battle where you draw out the blueprint for your ship

2014-12-03 19:26:04	@ssebelius	this one is great
2014-12-03 19:26:13	Roy_Fokker	ssebelius, i'd watch wes anderson version of star warts
2014-12-03 19:26:17	Slade	MikeP, hmm sounds like the mechanic would be troublesome.. 
2014-12-03 19:26:54	Slade	MikeP, unless you were doing drawing the same way the game black and white did its 'drawing'
2014-12-03 19:27:59	Slade	which is just a modified way of doing street fighter 2 moves with the mouse :P
2014-12-03 19:28:08	@MikeP	nah, you built your ship beforehand
2014-12-03 19:28:23	@MikeP	with vector drawing tools and then laying out components in the hull
2014-12-03 19:28:38	Slade	hm interesting
2014-12-03 19:28:53	Slade	any rampart like mechanics to it?
2014-12-03 19:28:54	Sirisian	lol, my monitor has a firmware bug. I should update that. "So yeah if you turn off your computer with the monitor on then when the computer starts back up after 10 minutes of being on it'll restart. It's fine, but you need to update the firmware."
2014-12-03 19:29:04	@MikeP	then it calculates moment of inertia, center of mass, etc for the ship
2014-12-03 19:29:13	@MikeP	so the placement of the engines and the shape of the ship matter for gameplay
2014-12-03 19:29:15	Slade	MikeP, oh you tried to make it too real. shame on you
2014-12-03 19:29:24	Slade	you can not compete with KSP. let it go :p
2014-12-03 19:29:40	@MikeP	it wasn't realistic. it was all 2D
2014-12-03 19:30:07	Slade	also, one of my favourite games from the dos days was a game called star control 2
2014-12-03 19:30:20	Slade	i think a good 2d space game could be something :)
2014-12-03 19:30:33	@ssebelius	isnt that just called FTL?
2014-12-03 19:30:36	@MikeP	I'm working on a different space game now :D
2014-12-03 19:30:43	Sirisian	aww
2014-12-03 19:30:44	Slade	FTL?
2014-12-03 19:30:48	Slade	MikeP, details? :D
2014-12-03 19:30:58	@MikeP	TBS, ala fire emblem and advance wars
2014-12-03 19:31:03	@MikeP	but with a 3D grid instead of 2D
2014-12-03 19:31:11	Roy_Fokker	MikeP, you copying bastard
2014-12-03 19:31:19	@MikeP	what?
2014-12-03 19:31:22	Slade	oh, along the ways of MOO
2014-12-03 19:31:29	Slade	ssebelius, http://sc2.sourceforge.net/  <-- open sourced
2014-12-03 19:31:41	Roy_Fokker	anyways, Flotilla 
2014-12-03 19:31:45	Roy_Fokker	nice 3d SPace game
2014-12-03 19:32:00	Roy_Fokker	but game play is a bit simplistic
2014-12-03 19:32:33	@MikeP	nah, this is going to be more like a board game, like FE and AW are
2014-12-03 19:32:43	@MikeP	a regular grid, turns, etc
2014-12-03 19:32:50	Roy_Fokker	Flotilla is turn-based
2014-12-03 19:32:55	Roy_Fokker	no grids 
2014-12-03 19:33:01	Roy_Fokker	but positioning matters
2014-12-03 19:33:24	Zol	Hurray! Finally done with preparation exercises for the Stirling engine exercise in 6 hours `o/
2014-12-03 19:33:31	@MikeP	yeah, my game is all about positioning 
2014-12-03 19:33:42	Roy_Fokker	well, it's 3d SPace game
2014-12-03 19:33:50	Roy_Fokker	so i would hope positioning matters
2014-12-03 19:33:57	@MikeP	your previous turn's move restricts your move set the following turn
2014-12-03 19:34:00	Slade	Zol, you're making stirling engines?
2014-12-03 19:34:03	@MikeP	i.e. momentum 
2014-12-03 19:34:07	Roy_Fokker	ah
2014-12-03 19:34:08	Slade	Zol, you a boat engine making?
2014-12-03 19:34:11	Slade	maker
2014-12-03 19:34:17	Roy_Fokker	did you look at kickstarter for Torchships?
2014-12-03 19:34:19	@MikeP	so your move space is like a pyramid with the tip at your ship
2014-12-03 19:34:20	Slade	if so, lets talk
2014-12-03 19:34:25	Roy_Fokker	don't make the same mistakes
2014-12-03 19:34:31	@MikeP	the faster you moved on a previous turn, the narrower your cone of movement
2014-12-03 19:34:35	Zol	Slade: No, I'm a computer science student, but we're having a course on thermodynamics and gases and stuff.
2014-12-03 19:34:49	Slade	Zol, oh, bummer. sorry about the choice in majors
2014-12-03 19:35:05	Zol	I'm taking a master also!
2014-12-03 19:35:21	Slade	http://sc2.sourceforge.net/screenshots/slaveshield.php   <-- damn starcon 2 had high quality graphics
2014-12-03 19:35:24	Zol	Not sure which field to chose.
2014-12-03 19:35:24	@MikeP	I got a masters degree. it's mostly worthless, but I got it for free, so...
2014-12-03 19:35:40	Slade	Zol, chemeng, mecheng, eleceng
2014-12-03 19:35:43	Zol	MikeP: Mine is also free.
2014-12-03 19:35:54	Slade	MikeP, you got it for free. someone handed it to you? or did you work for it
2014-12-03 19:35:55	@MikeP	free in time as well as money?
2014-12-03 19:35:56	Zol	Slade: I am mastering in CS
2014-12-03 19:36:05	@MikeP	Slade: I got it alongside my bachelors degree
2014-12-03 19:36:06	Zol	No
2014-12-03 19:36:07	Roy_Fokker	MikeP, he is in communist country
2014-12-03 19:36:14	Roy_Fokker	they have free higher education
2014-12-03 19:36:22	@MikeP	since I had to be in school anyway, I consider the time requirement to be null
2014-12-03 19:36:23	<--	refs (refs@refs.Users.AfterNET.Org) has quit (Quit)
2014-12-03 19:36:24	Zol	MikeP: Hm.. Not sure what you meant with free in time as well as money.
2014-12-03 19:36:26	Slade	MikeP, oh, weird. ok. i lack either. :P
2014-12-03 19:36:42	Slade	Zol, someone just handed it to him and was like 'here take this'
2014-12-03 19:36:48	@MikeP	Zol: if you have to stay in school for another two years to get it, that's a big opportunity cost
2014-12-03 19:36:51	Slade	in america we call that buy 1 get 1 free
2014-12-03 19:37:32	Slade	actually i shouldnt rag on MikeP, hes a worker :P
2014-12-03 19:37:59	Roy_Fokker	lol
2014-12-03 19:38:06	Vaayu	how'd you get masters alongside bachelors? oO
2014-12-03 19:38:09	Roy_Fokker	lazy wanker is more accurate
2014-12-03 19:38:11	@MikeP	my degrees were mostly pointless in general though, since I ended up doing software work anyway and they were all in hardware
2014-12-03 19:38:12	+Jovan	what the fuck? http://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/doom-game-creator-buys-heritage-resort-1.1938040
2014-12-03 19:38:24	Slade	MikeP, is your gpu your first real thing you're making in ... ah you went to school for hardwae
2014-12-03 19:38:56	@MikeP	;)
2014-12-03 19:39:08	Slade	haha john romero
2014-12-03 19:39:27	@MikeP	Vaayu: at my college, if you were in the honors program you could take literally as many classes you wanted, provided you kept up a B or higher in all of them
2014-12-03 19:39:41	Vaayu	fancy
2014-12-03 19:39:42	@MikeP	so I just kept cramming in classes and at the end they were like, well, I guess you have enough for a masters so here you go
2014-12-03 19:40:00	@MikeP	also a graduate certificate, which is like a minor for your masters degree
2014-12-03 19:40:06	@MikeP	in microelectronics and photonics :D
2014-12-03 19:40:20	@MikeP	I got all sorts of fancy stamped papers
2014-12-03 19:40:40	Sirisian	zao, I never knew that allergy shots can actually cure allergies. Weird. Was reading stories of people doing them for 2 years to get rid of allergies.
2014-12-03 19:41:08	Slade	Sirisian, depends on the type of shot, but sure
2014-12-03 19:41:26	@MikeP	Slade: at some point I'll probably leave finance and go work for NVIDIA or Intel or something and actually use my degree :D
2014-12-03 19:41:29	Rotaerk	inject peanutbutter into your veins, zao!
2014-12-03 19:41:35	Sirisian	:P
2014-12-03 19:41:43	Vaayu	never bothered with masters. frankly, even the bachelors was a waste. should've started my business earlier instead
2014-12-03 19:41:50	+AndrewBC	we can blame mikep for everything they do
2014-12-03 19:42:16	+AndrewBC	you ugly bag of water!
2014-12-03 19:42:19	Slade	MikeP, more money in finance, you just need to work hard figure out your own method, become rich adn use that money to start your own video card company or something
2014-12-03 19:42:56	Zol	MikeP: Yeah, that is what I have to do
2014-12-03 19:42:57	Vaayu	Slade: or instead, build the video card company and sell for millions?
2014-12-03 19:43:39	Slade	Vaayu, too much capital required to start one
2014-12-03 19:44:17	Vaayu	very easy to get investors nowadays
2014-12-03 19:44:26	Slade	tell that to amd
2014-12-03 19:45:54	Vaayu	well, they never had trouble with getting investors. just keeping them on board...
2014-12-03 19:46:08	Vaayu	with that kind of track record... *shrug*
2014-12-03 19:46:41	Vaayu	too much of intel's bitches instead of doing their own thing like ARM does
2014-12-03 19:47:51	ace4016	ouch http://gizmodo.com/the-sony-pictures-hack-exposed-budgets-layoffs-and-3-1665739357/1666122168/+ace
2014-12-03 19:47:55	Slade	nah they just misjudged mobile
2014-12-03 19:49:04	Vaayu	that's a bit of an understatement :P
2014-12-03 19:49:52	Roy_Fokker	ace4016, i guess they learned nothing from PSN hack
2014-12-03 19:50:05	ace4016	of course not
2014-12-03 19:50:08	Slade	i dont know how i feel about them getting out of chip production
2014-12-03 19:50:11	Vaayu	though not just misjudge, their execution was too shoddy. APUs were a great idea executed badly
2014-12-03 19:50:18	ace4016	security doesn't lead to profits Roy_Fokker!
2014-12-03 19:50:35	Roy_Fokker	i doubt they'll suffer due to this
2014-12-03 19:50:41	Roy_Fokker	so nothing will change
2014-12-03 19:50:50	Roy_Fokker	those poor employees however
2014-12-03 19:50:58	Roy_Fokker	well, good luck to them
2014-12-03 19:51:07	Slade	ace4016, it does if you're cisco!
2014-12-03 19:51:20	ace4016	it doesn't even then
2014-12-03 19:51:22	Roy_Fokker	Slade, and trust NSA?
2014-12-03 19:51:32	ace4016	bare minumum Slade; bare minimum
2014-12-03 19:51:44	Slade	ace4016, cisco makes lots of money off its security offerings
2014-12-03 19:51:52	ace4016	bare minimums
2014-12-03 19:52:01	Slade	bare minimums of what
2014-12-03 19:52:04	ace4016	they wouldn't be in business much if their solutions were perfect :P
2014-12-03 19:52:15	Slade	irrelevant. its profitable
2014-12-03 19:52:28	Slade	i was responding to this. <ace4016> security doesn't lead to profits Roy_Fokker!
2014-12-03 19:52:38	ace4016	for most companies, it doesn't
2014-12-03 19:52:47	Slade	correct
2014-12-03 19:52:54	Slade	thats the consumers choice tho
2014-12-03 19:52:56	Vaayu	"security" and "security theater" are different things
2014-12-03 19:52:56	ace4016	at least, that's what the CEOs will say
2014-12-03 19:53:05	Vaayu	the latter sells, the former doesn't :P
2014-12-03 19:53:05	JasonP	Ok, the original Kindle Fire has to be up there with the most horribly designed hardware ever...
2014-12-03 19:53:36	ace4016	JasonP, looked like a PoS excuse for a tablet
2014-12-03 19:53:37	Slade	ace4016, if people wanted security they'd have it
2014-12-03 19:53:46	Slade	or more of it anyhow
2014-12-03 19:53:53	JasonP	I am "fixing" one for a friend who told me: It won't hold a charge. Well it seems that when the battery gets critically low, it goes into a cycle where it will just 'give up' on charging.
2014-12-03 19:53:56	JasonP	ace4016, good call
2014-12-03 19:54:30	JasonP	So I had to do a hard reset on it, and now it seems to be taking a charge. So stupid.
2014-12-03 19:54:35	Vaayu	JasonP: it's on sale for 100$ though...
2014-12-03 19:55:05	JasonP	Vaayu, I think those are revised ones, the hardware went through a couple versions I understand
2014-12-03 19:55:18	JasonP	Hopefully better designed versions
2014-12-03 19:56:03	Slade	i talked to them a few years back. said "hardware division is going nowhere. i'll come in and fix it if you want"
2014-12-03 19:56:13	Slade	they thought they could handle it tho

2014-12-03 20:05:14	Vaayu	not all that bad though. still better off than a lot of other hardware companies (like nokia, blackberry...)
2014-12-03 20:05:40	ace4016	the kindle has the advantage of being related to books and amazon
2014-12-03 20:05:56	ace4016	even if the fire is shit for books
2014-12-03 20:06:20	Vaayu	yep, and amazon prime
2014-12-03 20:06:29	Vaayu	i hear the show selection is getting better and better

2014-12-03 20:23:21	+Jovan	Roy_Fokker, actually
2014-12-03 20:23:23	+Jovan	i just started playing uh
2014-12-03 20:23:26	+Jovan	two weeks ago?
2014-12-03 20:23:29	+Jovan	for the first time
2014-12-03 20:23:33	Slade	ace4016, yup :)
2014-12-03 20:23:47	Slade	ugh brb hotel internets
2014-12-03 20:23:55	+Jovan	Roy_Fokker, i come from the time of UO and it's been very difficult to find an MMO like that, but, i have a bit of hope in WoW since they started adding garrisons and shit
2014-12-03 20:23:58	ace4016	yay, hotel internets
2014-12-03 20:24:10	ace4016	(worst thing in the world next to 56k)
2014-12-03 20:24:19	Slade	yeay
2014-12-03 20:24:24	Slade	i didnt even lose connection
2014-12-03 20:25:05	Rotaerk	Jovan, I never got to play UO back in its hayday, and I'd been looking for one like it since
2014-12-03 20:25:17	Rotaerk	SWG supposedly had similar elements but I missed that too
2014-12-03 20:25:39	+Jovan	Rotaerk, that makes no sense >.>
2014-12-03 20:25:40	ace4016	Rotaerk, playe SWG-Emu :P
2014-12-03 20:25:53	Rotaerk	what makes no sense, Jovan ?
2014-12-03 20:26:02	Slade	ace4016,  ugh brb hotel internets
2014-12-03 20:26:05	Slade	err haha
2014-12-03 20:26:14	Rotaerk	ace4016, never heard of that
2014-12-03 20:26:17	Slade	ace4016, http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/what-are-the-differences-between-nuts-and-drupes.html
2014-12-03 20:26:49	Rotaerk	Jovan, oh my wording was odd I guess
2014-12-03 20:26:59	+Jovan	Rotaerk, you never got to play UO yet you're looking for something like it
2014-12-03 20:27:10	+Jovan	Rotaerk, UO is still alive y'know
2014-12-03 20:27:13	+Jovan	i'm sure there are popular shards
2014-12-03 20:27:17	Slade	ace4016, basically walnuts almonds pecans we eat the seed, :)
2014-12-03 20:27:39	Roy_Fokker	are you just discovering this?
2014-12-03 20:27:41	Rotaerk	I never got to play UO, but after playing other MMOs like WoW I started developing ideals for what I want an MMO to be like, and what I heard about UO seemed consistent with a lot of those ideals
2014-12-03 20:27:51	Roy_Fokker	did we suddenly turn into r/TIL
2014-12-03 20:27:51	ace4016	i'm aware
2014-12-03 20:27:53	--	Mode #gamedev [-b *!*@c-24-61-193-83.hsd1.nh.comcast.net] by X3
2014-12-03 20:27:53	Slade	ace4016, anyhow, points lost nevremind :p
2014-12-03 20:27:58	ace4016	all delicious
2014-12-03 20:28:05	Slade	i'm a big fan
2014-12-03 20:28:07	ace4016	and full of fat
2014-12-03 20:28:08	+Jovan	Rotaerk, a bunch of shit in WoW is a step back, but a lot of it is a step forward
2014-12-03 20:28:15	+Jovan	I mean the great majority of it is just flawless execution it's awesome
2014-12-03 20:28:21	Slade	most i prefer roasted maybe with a little salt
2014-12-03 20:28:22	ace4016	and inside that fat: dense amount of nutrients!
2014-12-03 20:28:23	+Jovan	the quest grind is fucking boring - that's where UO comes in
2014-12-03 20:28:40	Rotaerk	Jovan, what in WoW do you consider a step forward?
2014-12-03 20:28:51	Rotaerk	the one thing I'll give WoW credit for is its pristine level of polish
2014-12-03 20:29:04	Slade	clearly you werent there at release
2014-12-03 20:29:09	Rotaerk	I was
2014-12-03 20:29:15	Rotaerk	it wasn't polished at the time :P
2014-12-03 20:29:40	Rotaerk	other MMOs that have been out as long or longer aren't anywhere near as polished
2014-12-03 20:29:42	ace4016	if you listened to the fad type health nuts (no pun intended), you'd be eating a crap ton of fat free, sugar free, salt free cardboard.  tons of it because there are hardly any nutrients per gram in them :P
2014-12-03 20:29:45	Slade	"sorry people the mob servers down again, feel free to run around all the same"
2014-12-03 20:29:50	ace4016	you'd be a cow...
2014-12-03 20:30:08	Slade	i like cows
2014-12-03 20:30:11	Slade	for dinner
2014-12-03 20:30:14	@KnightTemplar	Rotaerk: Play SotA?
2014-12-03 20:30:17	+Jovan	Slade, I actually managed to download WoW and find a private beta shard
2014-12-03 20:30:21	ace4016	for dinner, YUM!
2014-12-03 20:30:24	+Jovan	back when it was still in that stage
2014-12-03 20:30:29	Slade	Jovan, fancy
2014-12-03 20:30:31	Rotaerk	KnightTemplar, I've considered trying it; it has my interest
2014-12-03 20:30:33	+Jovan	so that was my first glimpse of it, and it was fucking crappy but
2014-12-03 20:30:37	+Jovan	it's come a long way it seeems
2014-12-03 20:30:38	Rotaerk	thoguh I don't think I want to pay for early access
2014-12-03 20:30:44	Rotaerk	I've been burned by that too many times
2014-12-03 20:30:51	Mushu	It's still got a long way to go too.
2014-12-03 20:30:51	ace4016	Rotaerk, SWG-emu is the emulator project for SWG as it's a dead game otherwise
2014-12-03 20:31:01	Slade	Rotaerk, tell me, did you preorder DNF?
2014-12-03 20:31:03	Rotaerk	SWG still exists, I thought
2014-12-03 20:31:08	Rotaerk	it's just mutilated
2014-12-03 20:31:15	Rotaerk	Slade, lol. no

2014-12-03 20:33:18	@MaulingMonkey	picky picky
2014-12-03 20:33:23	Rotaerk	hmm did they actually shut down SWG
2014-12-03 20:33:31	Rotaerk	i think I tried it a year or two ago
2014-12-03 20:33:36	Rotaerk	so it must've been recent-ish
2014-12-03 20:33:41	ace4016	galaxies or the other one?
2014-12-03 20:33:47	Rotaerk	galaxies
2014-12-03 20:33:51	Rotaerk	I also tried TOR
2014-12-03 20:34:07	Slade	"If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution."  <-- from another channel, but i like this quote
2014-12-03 20:34:16	Rotaerk	TOR was basically WoW; was bored before I got halfway through my levels
2014-12-03 20:34:36	Roy_Fokker	Slade, before execution
2014-12-03 20:34:51	Roy_Fokker	heck they'd delete JAVA from your system while they were at it
2014-12-03 20:35:04	ace4016	Rotaerk, "Despite outcry from subscribers and Star Wars fans,[4] the servers shut down on December 15, 2011."
2014-12-03 20:35:08	Slade	tell us how you really feel Roy_Fokker 
2014-12-03 20:35:18	Roy_Fokker	what i am really saying Slade 
2014-12-03 20:35:20	Roy_Fokker	is
2014-12-03 20:35:21	ace4016	Rotaerk, also the emulator project doesn't go past NGE
2014-12-03 20:35:23	Roy_Fokker	FUCK JAVA
2014-12-03 20:35:40	Slade	ace4016, i always wondered what it'd take to go to one of these big studios and grab some of their dead/failed IP
2014-12-03 20:35:51	Roy_Fokker	quite a lot of money
2014-12-03 20:36:02	Slade	MikeP, you know anything about that?
2014-12-03 20:36:13	Rotaerk	ace4016, is that when sony fucked it up?
2014-12-03 20:36:18	Roy_Fokker	we (modding group i ran with) checked to see cost of one IP that Vivendi owned
2014-12-03 20:36:32	ace4016	Rotaerk, yup
2014-12-03 20:36:38	Roy_Fokker	they wanted 1million, for franchise which released it's last game in 1999
2014-12-03 20:36:52	Rotaerk	the only other MMOs besides SotA which I have on my radar right now are EVE and EQN
2014-12-03 20:37:05	@KnightTemplar	EVE sucks
2014-12-03 20:37:20	Rotaerk	it seems fun to me in theory, but I do get bored when I try to play it
2014-12-03 20:37:38	Slade	eve has done amazingly well. i'm proud of them
2014-12-03 20:37:57	Slade	(it being a game i'd enjoy is another matter)
2014-12-03 20:38:27	Slade	Rotaerk, they wanted 1 million for swg?
2014-12-03 20:38:52	Rotaerk	Slade, what?
2014-12-03 20:38:57	Slade	err sorry

2014-12-03 20:52:33	Slade	i'd made the assumption you could use any fuel injected engine alright
2014-12-03 20:52:41	Roy_Fokker	something that will allow him to finish Patlabor RPG

2014-12-03 20:56:03	ace4016	full authority digital engine controller
2014-12-03 20:58:43	ace4016	you tell it what you want and it delivers without you having to muck around
2014-12-03 20:59:02	Vaayu	i want a pizza
2014-12-03 20:59:07	Slade	ace4016, you need some interesting project.. anime and ben wa balls and classic music isnt a good thing ;)

2014-12-03 21:28:19	ace4016	there are a lot that can...from the island
2014-12-03 21:28:26	ace4016	in the US that's a different story
2014-12-03 21:28:46	ace4016	i found out the most probable cause though
2014-12-03 21:28:55	Slade	i dont know many in the US . most i knew were out there
2014-12-03 21:29:02	ace4016	though it's not much of an excuse anymore

2014-12-03 21:31:16	ace4016	hrm...should take the trash out
2014-12-03 21:31:30	Slade	so whats the most probably cause

2014-12-03 21:37:28	Slade	anyhow. whats your theory
2014-12-03 21:37:35	Slade	i'm just talking unscientific samplings here :)
2014-12-03 21:39:43	ace4016	historians seem to point the blame, in the US, for race relations.  you have generations that weren't allowed on beaches and pools.  no access to a body of water large enough to learn to swim.  and even after all that ended, those folk can't teach their kids (and also don't view it as something necessary to teach their kids).  so you then have the backlash that is seen in generations afterwards
2014-12-03 21:41:22	ace4016	i've had people think it was because the body density of black people was too high to maintain proper bouyancy :P
2014-12-03 21:41:28	Slade	huh, i woulda gone a different direction with that. interesting tho. also i thought you were first generation here
2014-12-03 21:41:38	Rotaerk	black people can't swim?
2014-12-03 21:41:47	Slade	ace4016, that was something they used to say about why they cant join the navy
2014-12-03 21:41:58	ace4016	i am, yea.  my parents didn't teach me though, even if they could
2014-12-03 21:42:11	ace4016	didn't have a pool and we went to the beach so rarely
2014-12-03 21:42:36	ace4016	so in my case it was just a lack of exposure
2014-12-03 21:42:45	ace4016	just like i never went to summer camp
2014-12-03 21:43:01	Slade	like sking, camping, ice skating i'm imagining

2014-12-03 21:55:45	ace4016	it's like "HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THAT!?"

2014-12-03 21:57:01	@KnightTemplar	is mysql still a toy database?
2014-12-03 21:57:12	Slade	in the sense that linux is still a toy OS
2014-12-03 21:57:34	Slade	they've integrated a lot of stability requirements. it does a few things irritating tho
2014-12-03 21:57:36	@KnightTemplar	compared to say, pgsql or mssql
2014-12-03 21:58:06	Slade	if you have the choice of the three i'd go mssql
2014-12-03 21:58:22	@KnightTemplar	well, mssql isn't a choice right now because it's running on freebsd
2014-12-03 21:58:26	Slade	pgsql has 2 things that irritate me. but its reliable.. 
2014-12-03 21:58:40	Slade	mysql has about 80 irritating things, but its reliable these days
2014-12-03 21:58:51	ace4016	what are you doing on BSD?

2014-12-04 03:27:02	LaptopBrain	and i've put my server in the utility cupboard
2014-12-04 03:27:05	LaptopBrain	:P
2014-12-04 03:27:46	mantis	LaptopBrain: well, I'm carving myself a 'daddy only' place 
2014-12-04 03:27:48	LaptopBrain	right now my desk has on it a 24" monitor, laptop, a switch, and a computer from 1986
2014-12-04 03:27:53	@zao	dualpurpose the printer cage as crib
2014-12-04 03:27:59	mantis	where kids can't bring they toys
2014-12-04 03:27:59	LaptopBrain	lol
2014-12-04 03:28:06	LaptopBrain	yeah, it has to be done
2014-12-04 03:28:07	mantis	(which doesn't stop my son)
2014-12-04 03:28:18	LaptopBrain	no kids come in here during work hours
2014-12-04 03:28:47	mantis	hah lucky you
2014-12-04 03:28:55	LaptopBrain	im lucky, we have one who's almost five and at school most of my work time, and two who are 1 and can't open the stair gates or climb the stairs unassisted :P
2014-12-04 03:28:59	mantis	theoretically the same applies here
2014-12-04 03:29:05	mantis	but that's only theory
2014-12-04 03:29:52	mantis	for example, in couple mins my girl is going to the court (we're taking custody of her young cousin, who lost his immediate family)
2014-12-04 03:30:03	mantis	and lo, I have to take care of kid
2014-12-04 03:30:38	@zao	mantis: schedule probably isn't loose enough to meetup :(
2014-12-04 03:30:58	@zao	unless thee is slack and he is in the area
2014-12-04 03:31:00	mantis	boo
2014-12-04 03:31:39	LaptopBrain	heh
2014-12-04 03:31:48	LaptopBrain	mantis, family time regularly encroaches on my work time
2014-12-04 03:32:09	LaptopBrain	like later on our eldest kid is going to football practice, she loves it, so i wouldnt have it any other way
2014-12-04 03:32:20	LaptopBrain	i do love my job, but anyone who thinks work comes before kids can do one :P
2014-12-04 03:32:39	mantis	so, like I said zao, come meet both of us at 31c3! ignore the hacktivism, grab some delicious beer with us :)
2014-12-04 03:33:09	LaptopBrain	mmm beer.
2014-12-04 03:33:12	mantis	luckily the kid we're going to be taking care of is nearly 15yo
2014-12-04 03:33:20	LaptopBrain	luckily? :P
2014-12-04 03:33:25	LaptopBrain	teenagers are the worst
2014-12-04 03:33:33	mantis	LaptopBrain: he's a bookworm actually
2014-12-04 03:33:37	LaptopBrain	we have one of those too, but hes hardly ever here...
2014-12-04 03:33:42	LaptopBrain	ah, lucky
2014-12-04 03:33:58	mantis	and this means that we need to take care of him only some time
2014-12-04 03:34:31	mantis	(there's also a chance he'll move to his uncle in USA when he's finished 15years and current class, that is in July
2014-12-04 03:39:45	LaptopBrain	im going to spend some time thinking up how to do simple animation i think
2014-12-04 03:42:27	Shadowdancer	hmmm 8TB SSD
2014-12-04 03:43:09	LaptopBrain	im thinking that it will be a simple matter of a really simple scripting-like language defined by a set of enums
2014-12-04 03:43:14	LaptopBrain	a bit like 'turtle graphics'
2014-12-04 03:43:21	LaptopBrain	"left 90 taking 1 second"

2014-12-04 03:56:25	mantis	yeah, it is
2014-12-04 03:56:32	mantis	god damn it, christmas is annoying
2014-12-04 03:57:01	mantis	basically it amounts to asking everybody in the family for what they want to get
2014-12-04 03:57:20	mantis	and telling them what you want to get
2014-12-04 03:57:34	mantis	which, unless you need inexpensive shit
2014-12-04 03:57:41	mantis	is just loss of value
2014-12-04 03:57:47	mantis	it was better as a kid >_>
2014-12-04 03:58:00	mantis	when you just got presents and nobody told you what you'll be getting
2014-12-04 03:59:20	mantis	basically, xmas nowadays is ALWAYS net loss
2014-12-04 03:59:57	mantis	because I'm earning more and more
2014-12-04 04:00:06	mantis	which means I'm expected to shell out more
2014-12-04 04:00:38	mantis	and from my grandparents, I can expect like 10 EUR worth of gift
2014-12-04 04:00:50	mantis	because they're poor and old and whatnot
2014-12-04 04:01:17	mantis	good thing my other granny has tons of cash, at least she'll provide something
2014-12-04 04:02:10	mantis	also, everybody except for my poor grandparents I'll just ask for cash
2014-12-04 04:02:28	mantis	to minimize impact of the cashdrain^wchristmas
2014-12-04 04:07:48	Sirisian	Okay took a nap for like 7 hours. I had an nightmare. So I was talking to other programmers and it came to light that everyone in the world confused java with javascript and the whole web was now written in something called nodejava. Like I was the only sane one and was like "where's node.js?" and they were all like "what? We use java here."
2014-12-04 04:07:52	Cahaan	I'm also feeling poor this month... I have a good salary but it's been drained by house+taxes for the house
2014-12-04 04:08:25	Cahaan	Sirisian, frightening
2014-12-04 04:10:06	Sirisian	yeah having a house is a lot of work. But then you pay it off and it's cheaper than rent.
2014-12-04 04:10:33	Cahaan	(+ an expensive restaurant for my wife's birthday who drained my Visa as well :p)
2014-12-04 04:10:48	Sirisian	But sometimes not cheaper than rent when actually taking the average. :| But it's bigger. But then again maintenance. It's an adult thing at least. yeah tradition.
2014-12-04 04:12:04	Sirisian	This is why I'm saving to build a house from scratch. If I'm going to get a house it's going to be awesome and custom. I want to go with Myst themed.
2014-12-04 04:14:20	Sirisian	http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/ This is hilarious
2014-12-04 04:14:51	Sirisian	A site where you can buy tickets not to your destination, but to other destinations which are cheaper because your real destination is a connecting flight.

2014-12-04 04:36:26	Shadowdancer	WOPE!

2014-12-04 04:37:59	Vaayu	the eternal dream
2014-12-04 04:38:09	Vaayu	the only way to still do that is using C...
2014-12-04 04:39:21	Ameisen	What about C++?
2014-12-04 04:42:04	Vaayu	doesn't work, especially if you use any of the fancier, newer features
2014-12-04 04:42:13	Vaayu	at which point, it's just C with Classes
2014-12-04 04:42:38	Ameisen	Which platforms don't support a significant number of the newer features?
2014-12-04 04:42:57	Ameisen	but do support C11?
2014-12-04 04:43:12	@zao	How does C11 come into the picture?
2014-12-04 04:43:26	@zao	C people generally don't need newer versions that much.
2014-12-04 04:43:26	Ameisen	Well, he said 'C', but implies that 'C++' must mean a newer standard (implying C++11, I presume)
2014-12-04 04:43:36	@zao	While C++ tends to require a rather competent and bleeding-arse compiler.
2014-12-04 04:43:41	Ameisen	So, it's fair to presume C must also mean the most recent version (C11).
2014-12-04 04:43:54	@zao	If people write C++, they tend to work on at best, a few years back in compilers.
2014-12-04 04:44:10	@zao	Like the fucker at work the other day, that used "C++11" (meaning GCC 4.8 and Apple Clang)
2014-12-04 04:44:16	Ameisen	That's fine, but I still don't know of any major platforms that have no support for C++11.
2014-12-04 04:44:25	Ameisen	Even the 360 has very limited support.
2014-12-04 04:44:34	@zao	Ameisen: How far back are you willing to deploy?
2014-12-04 04:44:46	@zao	We're very forward-looking, and we're on Ubuntu 12.04.
2014-12-04 04:44:52	Ameisen	Current-gen.
2014-12-04 04:44:54	@zao	Many others are on CentOS 6.x
2014-12-04 04:45:04	@zao	Ameisen: Are you annoyingly limiting yourself implicitly to games?
2014-12-04 04:45:10	@zao	Again.
2014-12-04 04:45:15	Ameisen	GCC and Clang have fantastic C++11 support, MSVC 2013 (and 2015) have fairly good support.
2014-12-04 04:45:35	Ameisen	well, this _is_ #gamedev.
2014-12-04 04:45:38	@zao	Yes.
2014-12-04 04:45:42	@zao	And we talk about everything.
2014-12-04 04:45:53	Ameisen	I dunno, I've been told to not talk about os development in the past.
2014-12-04 04:46:11	@zao	That might've been because you were disrupting something?
2014-12-04 04:46:15	@zao	Or were uninteresting?
2014-12-04 04:46:17	Ameisen	Though, regardless of what platform you're targetting for whatever software, your toolchains are going to be similar.
2014-12-04 04:46:21	 *	zao wobbles off in search of lunch.
2014-12-04 04:46:30	Ameisen	you're probably using GCC, Clang, or MSVC
2014-12-04 04:46:40	@zao	Ameisen: Your toolchains out in reality are the ones present on the systems, and those are at best "0x".
2014-12-04 04:46:55	@zao	CentOS has like 4.4. 12.04 has 4.6.
2014-12-04 04:46:59	@zao	None of those are "C++11"
2014-12-04 04:47:04	Ameisen	And you cannot deploy a newer version of GCC/Clang to them?
2014-12-04 04:47:11	@zao	Not realistically.
2014-12-04 04:47:18	@zao	The toolchain PPAs actively break things on the systems.
2014-12-04 04:47:34	@zao	And private deployment of libstdc++ is not only frowned upon, but also often impossible.
2014-12-04 04:47:41	Ameisen	I've used Clang on Ubuntu before.
2014-12-04 04:47:50	 *	Shadowdancer idly wonders if that one server at uni still runs Ubuntu 6.06
2014-12-04 04:47:55	@zao	And if you're delivering software, you're pretty much limited to what exists in the reposes.
2014-12-04 04:48:16	@zao	Ameisen: That Clang will be using the system libstdc++.
2014-12-04 04:48:39	@zao	I've got Intel 15, which has stellar C++11 functionality. It uses the system libstdc++ 4.6, as it _must_ stay ABI compatible.
2014-12-04 04:48:48	@zao	Guess how well that goes.
2014-12-04 04:49:11	@zao	The only way to deploy something newer onto a machine is to bundle up a whole platform, akin to the Steam Runtime.
2014-12-04 04:49:36	@zao	Now, lunch beckons.
2014-12-04 04:50:12	@zao	(we've got five different compilers on our systems, just to cover enough ground that _one_ of them ends up working with minor changes for particular software)
2014-12-04 04:51:58	Ameisen	The only difficulty we've had was with Android, but we just compiled a new cross-compiler for it
2014-12-04 04:52:02	Ameisen	and didn't have any issues after that

2014-12-04 05:11:21	LaptopBrain	which means that for this particular simple animation (raise block up slightly, rotate it 90 degrees anticlockwise, lower it back down) if i keep clicking the block over and over, it takes off and hovers :p

2014-12-04 07:58:44	mantis	I only now figured out why 'nightmares' are represented as flaming horses

2014-12-04 07:59:15	Sharlin	oh
2014-12-04 07:59:17	mantis	'night' 'mare'.
2014-12-04 07:59:23	Sharlin	the etymology is completely unrelated to horses, though
2014-12-04 07:59:30	mantis	oh, really?

2014-12-04 07:59:52	Sharlin	"The word derives from the Old English "mare", a mythological demon or goblin who torments others with frightening dreams."
2014-12-04 08:00:03	@zao	Middle English (denoting a female evil spirit thought to lie upon and suffocate sleepers): from night + Old English m?re ?incubus?.

2014-12-04 08:07:48	mantis	I wouldn't give them more than 50!
2014-12-04 08:08:20	Sharlin	actually the band's name comes from the word for a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers
2014-12-04 08:08:33	@zao	Sharlin: I don't think there's necessarily any gender involved in incubus.

2014-12-04 08:19:02	LaptopBrain	in visual studio when editing a c# project if i change the name of a member or method, it offers to auto refactor
2014-12-04 08:19:06	LaptopBrain	and usually, it does a god job.
2014-12-04 08:19:24	LaptopBrain	in the same suite, when editing a C++ project, no automatic offer to refactor, and i'm damned if i can find the option anywhere.
2014-12-04 08:19:37	Shadowdancer	"Fill-&-drain valves on 3 core boosters will be cycled open & closed to see if that solves the problem."  ? did you try turning it off and on again?

2014-12-04 08:20:57	mantis	pricing on turbogood version of VS
2014-12-04 08:21:11	mantis	I could pay them, say, 100USD/month
2014-12-04 08:21:13	LaptopBrain	ah, i have the 2012 of that
2014-12-04 08:21:18	@zao	LaptopBrain: If you want refactoring, consider a third party half-arsed solution like VAX or resharper (if they've released their C++ variant yet).
2014-12-04 08:21:41	LaptopBrain	so in other words
2014-12-04 08:21:43	@zao	mantis: Community/Professional not suitable?
2014-12-04 08:21:48	LaptopBrain	time to roll up my sleeves and refactor it myself
2014-12-04 08:21:51	@zao	LaptopBrain: Pretty much.
2014-12-04 08:22:22	mantis	zao: couple things require ultimate to run
2014-12-04 08:22:41	LaptopBrain	i hardly use half of the features of ultimate.
2014-12-04 08:22:43	mantis	for example, 'publish' functionality of MSO
2014-12-04 08:22:47	@zao	mantis: If you've got things that require Ultimate, you also have a sponsor that can afford Ultmiate.
2014-12-04 08:23:05	mantis	zao: well, currently I'm using my company supplied ultimate
2014-12-04 08:23:24	LaptopBrain	a past employer sorted me out a license for ultimate
2014-12-04 08:23:35	LaptopBrain	i could never afford it otherwise, which is why im hesitant to upgrade to community
2014-12-04 08:23:44	mantis	well, I've got license for Office Pro Plus

2014-12-04 08:24:20	mantis	unfortunately, features coded with pro plus, can only work in pro plus
2014-12-04 08:24:27	LaptopBrain	caffeine suppository. that's enough to put me off monster and rockstar for life...
2014-12-04 08:24:42	mantis	(first rule of pro plus is you can't use publish functionality outside of pro plus)
2014-12-04 08:25:04	mantis	I guess that makes sense, as the whole plugin I'm working on is basically a feature of Office Pro Plus >_<
2014-12-04 08:25:05	LaptopBrain	pro plus is the full-on everything edition isnt it?
2014-12-04 08:25:09	mantis	yeah

2014-12-04 08:25:42	mantis	I'm quite positive 365 doesn't have that
2014-12-04 08:25:52	mantis	because I did have 365 and couldn't use the functionality

2014-12-04 08:26:08	@zao	FIKA!
2014-12-04 08:26:14	LaptopBrain	i think its one of the next levels of licensing up
2014-12-04 08:26:46	LaptopBrain	if i remember, if you get it, it comes with a single license for some charting application or something
2014-12-04 08:27:01	LaptopBrain	i should know this, lol... i'm supposed to be aware of the licensing
2014-12-04 08:27:31	LaptopBrain	then again, that might just be the action pack copy i have on here that the directors also have

2014-12-04 08:42:32	LaptopBrain	mantis: imho the second was weak because he spent the whole time whinging about his lost love like a teenager, until he manned up and realised he was supposed to be a cold hard killer...
2014-12-04 08:42:54	LaptopBrain	but its quite smart how he started off in his first movie being a bit of a softie, easily led
2014-12-04 08:43:01	mantis	possibly. I just think that it was overcomplicated
2014-12-04 08:43:04	LaptopBrain	then he got manipulated, hurt, and toughened up into the bond we know and love

2014-12-04 11:00:33	bogdan	Hello.
2014-12-04 11:02:08	bogdan	I want to make a binary file with some database of the user information and I was wondering how to proceed: The header will contain an INT with the number of user and after that a vector that contains the adresses of each user in file and ANOTHER vector that contains the sizes.
2014-12-04 11:02:24	bogdan	INT with the number of users*
2014-12-04 11:02:42	bogdan	the sizes may be optional
2014-12-04 11:02:50	mantis	bogdan: why won't you just use a database?
2014-12-04 11:02:58	bogdan	for learning
2014-12-04 11:03:07	mantis	as in some flavor of SQL
2014-12-04 11:03:13	bogdan	its a project I want to make while I learn C++
2014-12-04 11:03:25	bogdan	its not the final project that matters
2014-12-04 11:03:43	mantis	well, learning how to use DB in your projects is also important
2014-12-04 11:03:45	mantis	:)
2014-12-04 11:03:58	mantis	and most likely will come into play more often as you make games :)
2014-12-04 11:04:10	mantis	but anyways, what's your question?
2014-12-04 11:04:32	bogdan	if is a good practice
2014-12-04 11:04:39	bogdan	or you have another idea
2014-12-04 11:04:46	bogdan	I never done this so..
2014-12-04 11:04:59	mantis	well, I gave you my idea ;)
2014-12-04 11:05:13	mantis	but yeah, whatever floats your boat
2014-12-04 11:06:06	mantis	do the user fields vary in size?
2014-12-04 11:06:11	bogdan	yes
2014-12-04 11:06:40	mantis	will you be using this to only store data, or also look up at run time?
2014-12-04 11:06:57	bogdan	in time.. 
2014-12-04 11:06:59	mantis	ie, will you unpack the data into memory, or will you be reading per request
2014-12-04 11:07:37	bogdan	Im not sure about that
2014-12-04 11:07:52	bogdan	I think from file
2014-12-04 11:08:07	bogdan	I dont need the data at a high frecv
2014-12-04 11:08:27	bogdan	I can even wait seconds to grab it
2014-12-04 11:08:31	Sirisian|Work	bogdan, storing data is done in two methods. Fixed width where a struture has a defined size and structure like struct record { char name[100]; char address[200]; int age; } or you can do variable width which is done a few ways but allows things like variable length strings.
2014-12-04 11:08:32	mantis	well, there's probably unlimited ways to do it
2014-12-04 11:09:02	bogdan	I have the structs with variabile width
2014-12-04 11:09:11	mantis	all of them are approximations (better or worse) of what an SQL system can do for you
2014-12-04 11:09:18	bogdan	char* username; etc..
2014-12-04 11:09:33	bogdan	after I receive the data from user I create the variabile
2014-12-04 11:09:40	bogdan	with the coresponding size
2014-12-04 11:09:50	bogdan	but I dont know how to create the header of the file
2014-12-04 11:10:01	mantis	Shadowdancer: you coming to 31C3? I never see you any more since I moved back to Poland :(
2014-12-04 11:10:34	bogdan	If I create a vector with adresses and maybe sizeof of every custom user its hard to make it variable
2014-12-04 11:10:44	bogdan	I must limit to a fixed size
2014-12-04 11:10:49	bogdan	I guess
2014-12-04 11:10:50	Sirisian|Work	bogdan, Are you going to have multiple readers/writers to the file?
2014-12-04 11:10:56	bogdan	yes
2014-12-04 11:10:58	mantis	bogdan: will you be modifying the entries?

2014-12-04 11:14:13	bogdan	I just wondered if thats a bad practice or something, if not.. Ill go back to working on it
2014-12-04 11:14:26	Sirisian|Work	The issue with variable width records and updating them is file structure fragmentation. Your idea of storing address and sizes works well. When you update a record and it no longer fits though you insert to the end. After a while you'll end up with gaps where old records used to be.
2014-12-04 11:14:54	mantis	bogdan: I mean will the entries be modified on run time
2014-12-04 11:14:54	Sirisian|Work	Not bad practice at all, but you'll need to defragment the structure usually.
2014-12-04 11:15:18	bogdan	and its posible to move the struct in the file ?
2014-12-04 11:15:28	bogdan	from an adress to another and delete the end ?
2014-12-04 11:16:29	bogdan	@mantis: yes.
2014-12-04 11:17:02	Sirisian|Work	Do note if you don't have a service you'll need a lock file basically for controlling transaction processing.
2014-12-04 11:18:03	Sirisian|Work	locking the whole file might be the simplest unless you want to get into actual database locking logic.
2014-12-04 11:18:16	Sirisian|Work	(with a log file)
2014-12-04 11:18:38	Rawr|Mac	screw it
2014-12-04 11:18:45	Rawr|Mac	Just like
2014-12-04 11:18:54	Rawr|Mac	defrag by rebuilding the entire file
2014-12-04 11:18:55	Rawr|Mac	offline
2014-12-04 11:18:57	Sirisian|Work	At that point you're basically implementing a database from scratch and it gets extremely complex. (two phase locking and index updating if you have them)
2014-12-04 11:19:13	Sirisian|Work	Rawr|Mac, that's actually ideal for small files.
2014-12-04 11:19:20	Rawr|Mac	define 'small'
2014-12-04 11:20:02	Sirisian|Work	well it depends. Defragmenting locks everyone out.
2014-12-04 11:20:17	Rawr|Mac	well i mean, is this for a multi-user situation?
2014-12-04 11:20:21	Rawr|Mac	or are we talking about somehting like
2014-12-04 11:20:25	Rawr|Mac	a save file archive format
2014-12-04 11:20:27	Sirisian|Work	yeah he said it's a toy program he's writing.
2014-12-04 11:20:30	Rawr|Mac	oh urgh
2014-12-04 11:20:38	Sirisian|Work	yeah undefined requirements hehe
2014-12-04 11:20:46	Rawr|Mac	Thats going to be complicated if you want to have like
2014-12-04 11:20:47	Rawr|Mac	uptime
2014-12-04 11:20:49	Rawr|Mac	and performance
2014-12-04 11:21:27	Sirisian|Work	"inserting and updating is O(1) with random O(n)." :P
2014-12-04 11:21:28	bogdan	You mean remake it by making another "copy" and after that link to it ?
2014-12-04 11:22:06	Rawr|Mac	basically you would create a new file and just iteratively insert old files into the new archive
2014-12-04 11:22:10	Rawr|Mac	so that there isn't any empty space
2014-12-04 11:22:33	Sirisian|Work	aka defragmenting. You can also do in place defragmenting.
2014-12-04 11:22:41	Sirisian|Work	shift everything left
2014-12-04 11:22:47	Rawr|Mac	thats true.
2014-12-04 11:23:14	Sirisian|Work	probably idea. A 20 GB database requiring an extra 20 GBs would make people angry. :P
2014-12-04 11:23:19	Sirisian|Work	ideal*
2014-12-04 11:23:24	Rawr|Mac	Sirisian|Work: works for redis
2014-12-04 11:23:29	Rawr|Mac	or was it mongodb
2014-12-04 11:23:31	Rawr|Mac	i'm not sure
2014-12-04 11:23:31	@zao	bogdan: It may be easier to rewrite a new file from the old data with your changes, instead of changing in-place.
2014-12-04 11:23:40	bogdan	well def wont be a 20Gb file. its just for learning

2014-12-04 17:03:40	Sirisian|Work	Okay I think I get it from the slides. That is complex.
2014-12-04 17:04:09	Rawr|Mac	Sirisian|Work: yeah, it looks like just packaged dx11/12 stuff
2014-12-04 17:04:14	Rawr|Mac	but somehow even harder to use
2014-12-04 17:04:35	Rawr|Mac	because this api glDrawCommandStatesNV(tokenBuffer, offsets[], sizes[], states[], fbos[], count)
2014-12-04 17:04:38	Rawr|Mac	is hilarious

2014-12-04 17:10:37	Sirisian|Work	I kind of want to write something cool in OpenGL, but then I remember 90% of my time will be stuck in debugging or reading those extension sheets.
2014-12-04 17:12:58	@MikeP	Rawr|Mac: yeah, .NET Core, and it's delivered as individual libraries
2014-12-04 17:13:04	Rawr|Mac	hm.
2014-12-04 17:13:07	@MikeP	so you can pick and choose what you need and deploy them alongside your app
2014-12-04 17:13:18	@MikeP	no need for an installer
2014-12-04 17:13:22	Rawr|Mac	Interesting
2014-12-04 17:13:24	@MikeP	plus faster turn-around on new features and updates
2014-12-04 17:13:33	Rawr|Mac	I thought they would have an entire implementation of the .net core on each platform
2014-12-04 17:13:39	Rawr|Mac	but they talk about .net native here
2014-12-04 17:13:57	@MikeP	I think .NET Core refers to the libs and the abstraction layer
2014-12-04 17:14:03	@MikeP	and maybe the JITer, not sure
2014-12-04 17:14:08	@MikeP	that part is kind of vague
2014-12-04 17:14:21	Rawr|Mac	So when I use say, a TCP library from .net core
2014-12-04 17:14:28	Rawr|Mac	I distribute netcoretcp.dll
2014-12-04 17:14:30	Rawr|Mac	or whatever?
2014-12-04 17:14:34	@MikeP	yeah
2014-12-04 17:14:39	@MikeP	System.Net probably
2014-12-04 17:14:45	@MikeP	system.net.dll
2014-12-04 17:14:50	Rawr|Mac	Sure
2014-12-04 17:15:13	Rawr|Mac	Oh, so if i'm deploying on Luddite McLudditeson's computer that doesn't have any .net wank
2014-12-04 17:15:17	Rawr|Mac	i only have to install the parts i Use
2014-12-04 17:15:20	@MikeP	yeah
2014-12-04 17:15:24	Rawr|Mac	and not have to distribute a 20 minute .net installer
2014-12-04 17:15:30	@MikeP	like, you include the JITer lib and whatever also with your app
2014-12-04 17:16:20	@MikeP	and if you .NET Native it, it boils it all down to a single native exe anyway
2014-12-04 17:17:56	Rawr|Mac	thats pretty cool
2014-12-04 17:18:16	Rawr|Mac	looks like they wnat .net core to be the same across all the things
2014-12-04 17:18:24	Rawr|Mac	like, phones and desktops and osx machines and linux things
2014-12-04 17:18:26	@MikeP	yeah
2014-12-04 17:18:36	Rawr|Mac	So what happens to the old .net stuff?
2014-12-04 17:18:40	Rawr|Mac	built on top of .net core?
2014-12-04 17:18:52	@MikeP	yeah
2014-12-04 17:19:08	Rawr|Mac	what is a 'BCL api'?
2014-12-04 17:19:15	@MikeP	base class library
2014-12-04 17:19:16	Rawr|Mac	ah
2014-12-04 17:19:30	@MikeP	that's the name they've always used for the parts of .NET that are... "core"ish :D
2014-12-04 17:19:52	Rawr|Mac	wait, so the .net framework
2014-12-04 17:19:58	Rawr|Mac	isn't based on .net core
2014-12-04 17:20:16	@MikeP	the big monolithic beast part? probably not at first
2014-12-04 17:20:32	@MikeP	well, they're going to do feature work in .NET Core
2014-12-04 17:20:50	@MikeP	and then pull it down into the monolithic framework thing once a year or whatever for an enterprise friendly release
2014-12-04 17:21:00	@MikeP	who cares. I won't use it anymore at all

2014-12-04 17:48:45	+SteelGolem	kk
2014-12-04 17:49:05	+SteelGolem	have any of you tried doing paper prototyping at the start of your game development processes?
2014-12-04 17:49:34	@MikeP	nope
2014-12-04 17:49:36	@MikeP	sounds boring
2014-12-04 17:50:10	ace4016	mm...what do you mean paper prototyping?
2014-12-04 17:50:21	ace4016	you can do so with turn based RPGs
2014-12-04 17:50:30	Sirisian|Work	SteelGolem, I've done paper prototyping of a UI with 3 test subjects as part of a human computer action class. A big part of it is just being there and watching a user use the game with tasks to complete or unguided.
2014-12-04 17:50:41	+SteelGolem	using paper, dice, props, any kind of coin or token or whatever, to simulate a game mechanic to come up with good ideas for it
2014-12-04 17:50:57	Sirisian|Work	More complex paper prototyping like what my professor did was with eye tracking.
2014-12-04 17:50:59	+SteelGolem	Sirisian|Work, yeah, i get the watching part fine
2014-12-04 17:52:01	+SteelGolem	i wouldn't know how to use it for game mechanics in games i know, the only time i've ever seen it done was for a board game, or a board game -styled video game
2014-12-04 17:52:26	+SteelGolem	i'm hoping to find examples of creating a paper prototype for various types of mechanics so i can get a better idea of what i'm supposed to be doing
2014-12-04 17:53:40	+SteelGolem	or hear about examples
2014-12-04 17:54:18	+SteelGolem	i'm kind of stuck jumping right into coding prototyping because i really don't know how i'm supposed to model, say, flappy bird, with a paper and tokens
2014-12-04 17:54:58	ace4016	i don't think it's approriate for all games
2014-12-04 17:55:08	Sirisian|Work	I hope you don't mean actual paper though. That's not actually done really. Most people prototype the real UI. Users will do stupid stuff like open the wrong menu or try to right click or double click or press buttons they think do things. Paper prototyping is really just making the UI more intuitive. Back in the day actual paper was used because UI designers couldn't code and prototyping a UI quickly wasn't as easy.
2014-12-04 17:55:28	ace4016	i will usually jot down some plot points, mechanics, and such; maybe draw pictures and diagrams
2014-12-04 17:55:37	ace4016	i play most of it in my head though
2014-12-04 17:55:46	+SteelGolem	it's definitely not for all games, i agree
2014-12-04 17:56:19	+SteelGolem	but i'm trying to figure out when and where it's appropriate, because you can make changes to a mechanic design alot faster with tokens and dice than if you have a pile of code
2014-12-04 17:56:37	+SteelGolem	i understand its efficiency, but i don't know how to go about using it because i don't have examples to understand it with
2014-12-04 17:56:46	+SteelGolem	i'm dumb like that
2014-12-04 17:57:58	+SteelGolem	i guess paper prototyping is better suited to board games
2014-12-04 17:58:17	+SteelGolem	but i've heard directly out of the mouths of professionals in the industry that they do use it
2014-12-04 17:58:35	Sirisian|Work	Might ask jpetrie. He wrote tools which are a good example of where user expectations might not match an engineer's vision.
2014-12-04 17:58:48	Sirisian|Work	though not really game design related.
2014-12-04 17:58:52	+SteelGolem	but as a game designer...
2014-12-04 17:58:53	+SteelGolem	yeah
2014-12-04 17:59:02	+SteelGolem	i'm right at the very start of the entire process
2014-12-04 17:59:10	+SteelGolem	before you even get anyone else involved
2014-12-04 17:59:32	+SteelGolem	oh well, forget about it
2014-12-04 18:00:01	+SteelGolem	i might just forget the whole paper thing, even if it takes longer to iterate through a digital prototype, i at least understand that
2014-12-04 18:00:15	Sirisian|Work	"i really don't know how i'm supposed to model, say, flappy bird, with a paper and tokens" <-- heh "Do you find pressing the screen to flap intuitive." "Try flapping" *touches paper* "Good, that's what I expected." "yay, I'm helping." It's like portal 2 jump scene.
2014-12-04 18:00:17	+SteelGolem	a concept is no good to me if i can't engineer it
2014-12-04 18:00:30	+SteelGolem	Sirisian|Work,  no no no, conceiving of the game idea is what i'm after
2014-12-04 18:00:37	+SteelGolem	the method of input isn't important
2014-12-04 18:00:53	+SteelGolem	"you make a bird go up into the air and try to get it through gates"
2014-12-04 18:00:59	@KnightTemplar	SteelGolem: You're modelling mechanics, not actual birds :P
2014-12-04 18:00:59	+SteelGolem	that's the core game mechanic
2014-12-04 18:01:05	+SteelGolem	KnightTemplar, right!
2014-12-04 18:01:24	DeM0nFiRe	if you want to come up with the next killer mobile game, just go look for what flash games people played in elementary school 10 years ago
2014-12-04 18:01:36	+SteelGolem	>wanting to make mobile games at all
2014-12-04 18:01:46	+SteelGolem	it was an example everyone should know, that's the only reason i used it
2014-12-04 18:02:22	+SteelGolem	i'm learning to develop games now
2014-12-04 18:02:26	+SteelGolem	i already know how to code and make assets
2014-12-04 18:02:41	+SteelGolem	i'm trying to understand how you go from an idea to code
2014-12-04 18:02:44	Sirisian|Work	Basically unless a person is retarded or has never touched a game you should be fine with most mechanics. Hell look at Myst. A game based around the idea of never paper prototyping and seeing what happens.
2014-12-04 18:03:03	+SteelGolem	hahah point and click adventures, man.
2014-12-04 18:03:10	+SteelGolem	just, nope.
2014-12-04 18:03:19	+SteelGolem	i want to PLAY
2014-12-04 18:03:25	+SteelGolem	not solve puzzles
2014-12-04 18:03:38	Sirisian|Work	"I click the handle? Nothing happened. I'm lost" "You were supposed to hold it and rotate it 270 degrees then release. Obviously"
2014-12-04 18:03:39	+SteelGolem	silly notion, calling myst a game
2014-12-04 18:03:57	Sirisian|Work	It's an experience. :P
2014-12-04 18:04:03	+SteelGolem	so is taking a dump!
2014-12-04 18:04:13	Sirisian|Work	Are you sure you didn't play Pyst?
2014-12-04 18:04:36	+SteelGolem	( ? ??)? ?????????
2014-12-04 18:05:08	+SteelGolem	for a realtime tactics game, okay, i can kinda see how you'd use a paper prototype
2014-12-04 18:05:33	+SteelGolem	you can boil that down to something like a board game
2014-12-04 18:05:53	Sirisian|Work	"I select the unit then turn off the game?" "No" "Click on a tile to move that's green?" "yes"
2014-12-04 18:06:02	+SteelGolem	maybe the thing that MITx wasn't telling me, was that all of the people that talked about paper prototypes made kids games and dinky toy things
2014-12-04 18:06:16	+SteelGolem	i may have to go back and re-evaluate 
2014-12-04 18:06:27	+SteelGolem	they had many people on that made edutainment
2014-12-04 18:06:39	Sirisian|Work	I guess that's not real-time. Thought you said turn based.
2014-12-04 18:07:07	+SteelGolem	yeah, but you can understand a realtime game as a series of steps in time, essentially making it turn-based
2014-12-04 18:07:13	+SteelGolem	so it still works
2014-12-04 18:07:26	Sirisian|Work	oh yeah we had a person at gpwiki ryan. He made kids games and would prototype them with kids to make sure they were as easy as he thought.
2014-12-04 18:07:43	Sirisian|Work	Very important since kids are dumb.
2014-12-04 18:07:52	+SteelGolem	kids games are simple, and representing things with simple objects isn't hard
2014-12-04 18:08:12	+SteelGolem	yeah i might have to just trash the idea of paper prototyping
2014-12-04 18:08:15	+SteelGolem	it's kind of dumb.
2014-12-04 18:08:52	+SteelGolem	i can imagine the things you do in a game easily enough, i don't need physical representations
2014-12-04 18:09:02	+SteelGolem	i can change things in my imagination pretty easily too
2014-12-04 18:09:32	+SteelGolem	now i wonder who the game development course was even aimed at
2014-12-04 18:10:30	Sirisian|Work	The HCI professor of my university taught the games development class. The two areas are very related.
2014-12-04 18:10:42	+SteelGolem	what does HCI mean?
2014-12-04 18:10:43	DeM0nFiRe	You are probably going to have to use multiple tools at multiple stages of development to test the design of a game.
2014-12-04 18:10:48	Sirisian|Work	human computer interaction
2014-12-04 18:10:56	+SteelGolem	so, UI dev?
2014-12-04 18:10:56	Sirisian|Work	that's where paper prototyping comes from
2014-12-04 18:10:58	DeM0nFiRe	And what tools to use depends on what stage of development you are at and what kind of game you are making
2014-12-04 18:11:12	Sirisian|Work	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction
2014-12-04 18:11:14	+SteelGolem	DeM0nFiRe, absolutely.
2014-12-04 18:11:26	DeM0nFiRe	paper prototyping of an FPS doesn't make sense. Paper prototyping of a TCG or a tactical RPG certainly could
2014-12-04 18:11:55	DeM0nFiRe	(Actually, paper prototyping of an FPS even could make sense, depending on what is in the game other than "you can shoot people"
2014-12-04 18:11:56	DeM0nFiRe	)
2014-12-04 18:12:01	+SteelGolem	DeM0nFiRe, with an FPS they suggested getting a group of friends with some nerf guns and making rules
2014-12-04 18:12:15	@MikeP	heh
2014-12-04 18:12:16	+SteelGolem	so technically not PAPER in the traditional sense, but it fits in the class of prototyping
2014-12-04 18:12:18	DeM0nFiRe	That is probably a dumb idea
2014-12-04 18:12:23	@MikeP	most things you can do in an FPS these days can't be recreated in real life
2014-12-04 18:12:26	@KnightTemplar	DeM0nFiRe: Paper prototyping actually works just fine for an FPS
2014-12-04 18:12:29	DeM0nFiRe	Because it would probably be easier to just throw shit together in an unreal game or a unity game
2014-12-04 18:12:40	+SteelGolem	again i'm starting to think they're aiming this course at people wanting to make games for kids
2014-12-04 18:13:03	DeM0nFiRe	MikeP: I am sure Valve did real life testing of the gravity gun
2014-12-04 18:13:05	+SteelGolem	yeah, unity came up quite a bit
2014-12-04 18:13:07	DeM0nFiRe	And the portal gun
2014-12-04 18:13:16	@MikeP	yeah, one of the big benefits of the engine toolkits is fast prototyping
2014-12-04 18:13:21	Sirisian|Work	FPS games are tested with things like heat maps to find how users interact and navigate a level. Kind of different and more geared for making sure users interact with the levels in a correct and intuitive way. (Take the right directions).
2014-12-04 18:13:23	@MikeP	just build your prototype in that
2014-12-04 18:13:32	@MikeP	don't waste time with something that doesn't correspond to anything you're actually going to do
2014-12-04 18:13:38	+SteelGolem	doesn't it cost money to use unity?
2014-12-04 18:13:44	DeM0nFiRe	SteelGolem: unity's biggest strength is rapid prototyping. Actuall trying to bring a game to completion after that in it is kind of a PITA, but for prototyping it's good
2014-12-04 18:13:46	@MikeP	there is a free version
2014-12-04 18:13:50	+SteelGolem	it doesn't matter tho, i'm not making 3d games
2014-12-04 18:13:53	DeM0nFiRe	yeah there is a free unity you can se
2014-12-04 18:13:59	DeM0nFiRe	You can use unity for 2d just fine
2014-12-04 18:14:00	@MikeP	so what? you can do 2D in a 3D engine
2014-12-04 18:14:04	+SteelGolem	i can prototype 2d games pretty fast with XNA
2014-12-04 18:14:12	+SteelGolem	i'm already comfortable with that, so it's all good
2014-12-04 18:14:15	@MikeP	not anywhere near as fast as you can with an engine
2014-12-04 18:14:15	+SteelGolem	thanks for the suggestion though
2014-12-04 18:14:21	@MikeP	but the learning curve is a legit point

2014-12-04 18:15:09	+SteelGolem	yeah, definitely.
2014-12-04 18:15:12	@MikeP	or unreal
2014-12-04 18:15:16	+SteelGolem	i really aught to get on that
2014-12-04 18:15:26	DeM0nFiRe	Yeah, I still haven't got around to trying out unreal, I really should
2014-12-04 18:15:47	Apocx_	Anyone know some good articles for writing complex IK interactions, such as two units fighting/grappling with one another?
2014-12-04 18:19:07	Sirisian|Work	Promit might know.
2014-12-04 18:19:19	Sirisian|Work	He's been doing a lot of procedural animation stuff lately.
2014-12-04 18:19:57	+SteelGolem	how does procedural animation relate to IK?
2014-12-04 18:20:35	+SteelGolem	oh, right. nevermind me
2014-12-04 18:20:40	+SteelGolem	animation was the keyword
2014-12-04 18:21:01	+SteelGolem	maybe i need to take a break from studying
2014-12-04 18:21:06	+SteelGolem	maybe i should start fscking DOING
2014-12-04 18:21:08	Sirisian|Work	well more about non keyframe based animation.
2014-12-04 18:21:12	+SteelGolem	instead of asking goddamn questions
2014-12-04 18:21:45	+SteelGolem	i need to start failing!
2014-12-04 18:21:49	Sirisian|Work	asking questions is good though. I've been working for like 10 hours. This channel is the only thing that keeps me sane. My coworker has been sick for 4 days now.
2014-12-04 18:21:50	+SteelGolem	and then learn to fail faster!
2014-12-04 18:21:57	Apocx_	I actually have most of the IK bits already, my issue is making it work fluidly. i.e. make unit A move behind unit B and put him in a headlock, etc. basically, getting the unit into the position they need to be in to actually use the IK solver to do what it needs to do, land a punch, kick, etc.
2014-12-04 18:22:18	Apocx_	to get them in position where the IK can be solved
2014-12-04 18:22:20	+SteelGolem	sounds like a states thing 
2014-12-04 18:22:47	+SteelGolem	but i'm thinking of old wrestling games
2014-12-04 18:22:59	+SteelGolem	and not particularly about how the IK fits in
2014-12-04 18:23:56	Apocx_	it's not so much a fighting game, was just using that as an example. I'd actually be implementing animal attacking animations, where they can attack from any direction, and attack different body parts
2014-12-04 18:24:23	Apocx_	including some where the animal hanging off of its prey, like lions on an elephant
2014-12-04 18:24:42	+SteelGolem	making the next tokyo jungle, i see
2014-12-04 18:24:44	+SteelGolem	fair enough
2014-12-04 18:25:05	Apocx_	I just don't want it to look too scripted, like as soon as they get within X distance, they suddenly warp to their "attack" position
2014-12-04 18:25:45	Apocx_	I've got the IK in so the heads can be moved to a position and play the bite animation, just need to figure out a good way to get the animal into position to make the IK have a solution so it isn't biting air
2014-12-04 18:26:15	Apocx_	but maybe I'm overthinking this and should just do something dirt simple like a distance calculation. I don't know
2014-12-04 18:26:29	+SteelGolem	try it and see how it looks
2014-12-04 18:26:35	Apocx_	that's why I'm trying to find some articles on the subject, see what other people have done
2014-12-04 18:26:42	Apocx_	I know sports games do a fair amount with IK
2014-12-04 18:26:51	Apocx_	and procedural anim
2014-12-04 18:27:10	+SteelGolem	.seen promit
2014-12-04 18:27:11	Apocx_	yeah probably will if I can't find anything else
2014-12-04 18:27:18	+SteelGolem	restricted commands
2014-12-04 18:27:32	+SteelGolem	instead of restricting commands, restrict abusers

2014-12-04 18:32:05	+SteelGolem	i should try to prototype a simple game every day from now until christmas or something

2014-12-04 18:33:04	+SteelGolem	and make a game out of it
2014-12-04 18:33:08	+SteelGolem	i should start there.
2014-12-04 18:33:22	+SteelGolem	sorry i'm making this place a blog again
2014-12-04 18:33:23	Slade-	SteelGolem, a new game every day?

2014-12-04 18:33:41	+SteelGolem	Slade-, that would be neat but now i wonder if i can even do that
2014-12-04 18:33:51	+SteelGolem	i need to find out how long it takes to prototype something
2014-12-04 18:34:03	Slade-	depends on what the something is
2014-12-04 18:34:32	Slade-	12 days of christmas.. day 12s prototype can use day 1s stuff
2014-12-04 18:34:57	Slade-	its a good mental exercise anyhow

2014-12-04 18:40:10	+SteelGolem	a single day seems like too little time
2014-12-04 18:40:28	Slade	depends on how much time you have to spend on it, and if you're making a polished game or a prototype
2014-12-04 18:40:30	+SteelGolem	consider that LD48 is 2 days for a fully functional, pre-conceived game
2014-12-04 18:40:51	+SteelGolem	i might be able to do a game every day
2014-12-04 18:41:41	+SteelGolem	it's too late to start one today
2014-12-04 18:41:45	Slade	i mean if you're going pure console/text. you can do war in an hour
2014-12-04 18:41:53	+SteelGolem	24 days is probably too many days for now too
2014-12-04 18:42:02	+SteelGolem	i'll say, one game every day for the next week and see how that goes
2014-12-04 18:42:16	+SteelGolem	an hour?
2014-12-04 18:42:17	+SteelGolem	no
2014-12-04 18:42:18	+SteelGolem	i couldn't
2014-12-04 18:42:43	Slade	no? how about oldmaid?
2014-12-04 18:43:04	Slade	(worst game ever)
2014-12-04 18:43:09	+SteelGolem	actually lemme look up the rules to war
2014-12-04 18:43:15	+SteelGolem	old maid yeah, probably
2014-12-04 18:43:19	+SteelGolem	in an hour though
2014-12-04 18:43:23	+SteelGolem	an hour is a very short amount of time
2014-12-04 18:43:50	Slade	if its just text messages and no graphics and "press any key to war"  its pretty simple
2014-12-04 18:44:41	+SteelGolem	hmm yeah i could maybe make war in an hour
2014-12-04 18:44:48	Slade	list of cards. shuffle routine. deal routine. draw routine
2014-12-04 18:44:54	+SteelGolem	these rules are different than i remember though
2014-12-04 18:45:06	Slade	everyone plays war with street rules
2014-12-04 18:45:10	Slade	plus some people confuse war with snap
2014-12-04 18:45:26	Slade	or integrate the two games
2014-12-04 18:46:42	Slade	2 hours for the game.  some betting.. and a little polish 
2014-12-04 18:46:58	+SteelGolem	lol betting
2014-12-04 18:47:04	ace4016	heh, gamefaqs still have ascii guides
2014-12-04 18:47:05	+SteelGolem	always gotta bet on cards

2014-12-04 18:49:13	+SteelGolem	ehhh no it doesn't
2014-12-04 18:49:18	+SteelGolem	i've made card games
2014-12-04 18:49:22	Slade	making game loops. because war game loop is very different from poker
2014-12-04 18:49:29	+SteelGolem	they're good exercises for people that can't code yet
2014-12-04 18:49:32	+SteelGolem	i can already code

2014-12-04 18:50:44	+SteelGolem	what? i don't think you understand the idea of a prototype
2014-12-04 18:50:47	Slade	i expect "the code" to be in there :)
2014-12-04 18:51:05	+SteelGolem	level layout in a platforming prototype has like one platform.
2014-12-04 18:51:12	+SteelGolem	maybe two.

2014-12-04 18:53:26	Slade	yup
2014-12-04 18:53:35	Slade	and sonic has physics requirements for angles of platforms
2014-12-04 18:53:41	Slade	you can be on platforms upside down

2014-12-04 23:01:51	Mushu	not sure, gw2 doesn't seem to be able to initialize a graphics context over it

2014-12-04 23:11:25	Slade	seen some cool kvms over ip that are pretty good 
2014-12-04 23:12:06	Slade	for 2 port just buy something random off amazon and return it if you dont like it

2014-12-04 23:16:42	Rotaerk	haskell has a fairly extensive set of libraries
2014-12-04 23:17:03	Rotaerk	it definitely doesn't have the selection that, say, C# has but... it's not barren

2014-12-04 23:27:59	DeM0nFiRe	Rotaerk: It gets you not having to do all the stuff that the library does for you. Same as any other library
2014-12-04 23:27:59	basehead	Rotaerk: i don't understand your comparison.  opengl like directx is a low-level way to communicate with the gpu but it's not a 'graphics engine'
2014-12-04 23:28:22	Rotaerk	yes, but what does a graphics engine *do* that GL doesn't
2014-12-04 23:28:45	basehead	OK say you have a model file
2014-12-04 23:28:58	basehead	how do you draw it with opengl?
2014-12-04 23:29:02	basehead	without making a graphics library using opengl
2014-12-04 23:29:04	DeM0nFiRe	Well, irrlicht for example does filesystem stuff, multiple platforms, multiple rendering backends, windowing stuff, input stuff, GUI stuff

2014-12-04 23:29:49	Rotaerk	hmm, so simplification of rendering existing model formats
2014-12-04 23:29:55	Rotaerk	and lighting and animation
2014-12-04 23:30:05	Slade	Rotaerk, has a timing and rendering loop usually
2014-12-04 23:30:10	basehead	if you make your own model format, you have to implement it in your engine
2014-12-04 23:30:20	Slade	usually a series of 'terrain' systems
2014-12-04 23:30:36	Rotaerk	I'm thinking I'd just do 2D; 3D seems like a bad idea for low-budget stuff
2014-12-04 23:30:57	Slade	Rotaerk, depends. minecraft wasnt a bad idea
2014-12-04 23:31:45	Rotaerk	low-quality-2D graphics can look charming, but 3D tends to just look like shit up until it's high quality
2014-12-04 23:32:50	wartech0	KnightTemplar, thats right
2014-12-04 23:32:56	wartech0	we can only have one wartech here
2014-12-04 23:33:06	Slade	sometimes. either way 3d rendering engine is just fine for 2d graphics
2014-12-04 23:33:15	DeM0nFiRe	Rotaerk: I think doom style graphics could work well. Or zelda64 style
2014-12-04 23:33:27	Slade	doom was 2d :P

2014-12-04 23:33:49	Rotaerk	does a 3D graphics engine buy you much over opengl for 2D?
2014-12-04 23:33:52	wartech0	no U!
2014-12-04 23:33:59	DeM0nFiRe	Let's not get into a ridiculously fucking stupid semantics argument
2014-12-04 23:34:04	Rotaerk	I mean, my "model" is just a rectangle for sprites
2014-12-04 23:34:14	wartech0	DeM0nFiRe, NAH NAH
2014-12-04 23:34:18	wartech0	it HAS DEPTH BRO!
2014-12-04 23:34:19	DeM0nFiRe	Rotaerk: Windowing, input, multiple platforms, loading of images
2014-12-04 23:34:21	Rotaerk	no need for animating the model, or have complex lighting schemes
2014-12-04 23:34:33	Purebe	I like SDL 
2014-12-04 23:34:38	wartech0	me too
2014-12-04 23:34:45	Slade	Rotaerk, some of them have UI systems. quick application of effects and other things
2014-12-04 23:34:58	wartech0	but I almost always spin up a opengl context in SDL
2014-12-04 23:35:00	Rotaerk	hmmlooks like haskell has SDL bindings
2014-12-04 23:35:20	basehead	this channel is amazingly active
2014-12-04 23:35:26	basehead	at almost any time
2014-12-04 23:35:31	wartech0	well
2014-12-04 23:35:32	Rotaerk	seemed like OGL was more flexible than SDL though... I don't recall it being easy to, say, stretch a sprite in SDL
2014-12-04 23:35:39	wartech0	thats because I am here basehead 
2014-12-04 23:35:41	Rotaerk	whereas in OGL you just increase the size of the rectangle
2014-12-04 23:35:48	Rotaerk	via scaling transform
2014-12-04 23:35:56	wartech0	yea
2014-12-04 23:36:01	wartech0	thats the downside to SDL
2014-12-04 23:36:02	Slade	not talking about sdl
2014-12-04 23:36:08	wartech0	you can't do things like scale
2014-12-04 23:36:10	wartech0	rotation
2014-12-04 23:36:10	Slade	talking about irrlicht and unity and ogre and such
2014-12-04 23:36:11	wartech0	etc
2014-12-04 23:36:24	DeM0nFiRe	SDL can't scale and rotate? Huh, that is pretty dumb
2014-12-04 23:36:28	wartech0	yea it is...
2014-12-04 23:36:56	wartech0	DeM0nFiRe, I think they are liking doing it oldschool
2014-12-04 23:37:02	wartech0	and blitting to a fbo
2014-12-04 23:37:11	DeM0nFiRe	Also, Rotaerk, you said 2d games can look good, but that is if you go for like a SNES or NES style, so you don't necessarily need scaling and rotating (unless you want to do mode 7 stuff)
2014-12-04 23:37:42	wartech0	scaling is a must these days!
2014-12-04 23:37:48	wartech0	I have to be able to zoom in and out
2014-12-04 23:37:59	wartech0	and rotation? I can see tons of reasons to rotate things
2014-12-04 23:38:27	DeM0nFiRe	Not in a pixelly game. Well, you need to be able to scale the whole game up by whole numbers
2014-12-04 23:38:35	Purebe	It has been a while since I used SDL but I would have swore I used both scales and rotates the last time without any issue
2014-12-04 23:38:38	wartech0	which you can't do DeM0nFiRe 
2014-12-04 23:38:42	DeM0nFiRe	'cause looking at 16x16 tiles on a 1920x1080 screen would be ridic
2014-12-04 23:38:51	wartech0	Purebe, did you use rotozoom?
2014-12-04 23:38:58	Purebe	I don't know :x
2014-12-04 23:39:01	wartech0	because thats about the only way to do it
2014-12-04 23:39:02	DeM0nFiRe	I would find it hard to believe that it wouldn't be possible to do what I am thinking of in sdl
2014-12-04 23:39:09	wartech0	its blitting
2014-12-04 23:39:17	wartech0	you blit to a screen
2014-12-04 23:39:22	wartech0	you can actually scale
2014-12-04 23:39:27	DeM0nFiRe	http://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_BlitScaled
2014-12-04 23:39:28	wartech0	but its going to be a CPU side scale
2014-12-04 23:39:34	DeM0nFiRe	So what?
2014-12-04 23:39:39	wartech0	slow as fuck bro
2014-12-04 23:39:51	Rotaerk	suppose I could look into the OGRE bindings
2014-12-04 23:40:07	Slade	Rotaerk, if you dont wanna go ue4 or unity. go irrlicht or ogre and be done with it
2014-12-04 23:40:08	DeM0nFiRe	wartech0: Do you understand how much more powerful the current hardware is compared to the games that did what you would be trying to do
2014-12-04 23:40:25	wartech0	so leverage it correctly
2014-12-04 23:40:46	Purebe	I *think* the SDL2.0 stuff is hardware accelerated
2014-12-04 23:41:03	wartech0	it might be
2014-12-04 23:41:09	wartech0	idk I just start an opengl context
2014-12-04 23:41:12	Rotaerk	Slade, well unless I get a satisfying prototype built using free technologies, I don't want to pay for an engine
2014-12-04 23:41:13	DeM0nFiRe	If you are making a NES or SNES style game, that is going to be capped at 30 to 60fps anyway, you can afford a few CPU side blits
2014-12-04 23:41:14	wartech0	I don't even screw with that crap
2014-12-04 23:41:25	Rotaerk	Slade, so none of those proprietary engines interest me right now
2014-12-04 23:41:26	DeM0nFiRe	Especially since if you're not dumb, you do the blits at most once per frame
2014-12-04 23:41:35	DeM0nFiRe	But really you can probably do it once per run
2014-12-04 23:41:51	Slade	Rotaerk, unity has a free version
2014-12-04 23:41:53	wartech0	Rotaerk, whatever you do
2014-12-04 23:41:56	wartech0	don't use ogre
2014-12-04 23:41:57	Rotaerk	and I suppose I am allowing my language preference be too strong of an influence
2014-12-04 23:41:59	wartech0	for the love of god
2014-12-04 23:42:12	wartech0	Rotaerk, just use opengl?
2014-12-04 23:42:28	Rotaerk	wartech0, well that's what I was considering, but Slade is making that out to be way-too-low-level
2014-12-04 23:42:37	Rotaerk	impractical, wheel-reinvention
2014-12-04 23:42:39	DeM0nFiRe	It's not way too low level
2014-12-04 23:42:50	DeM0nFiRe	You can do it if you want
2014-12-04 23:42:56	DeM0nFiRe	But you asked what the point of using a library is
2014-12-04 23:42:57	Slade	Rotaerk, yea. need to decide what you are doing. you're not a haskel advocate. you're not an engine builder. you want to make games
2014-12-04 23:43:03	DeM0nFiRe	It does things so you don't have to
2014-12-04 23:43:23	Rotaerk	Slade, I'm a haskell advocate :P I just *also* want to make a game... and preferably in the language I like
2014-12-04 23:43:24	DeM0nFiRe	Up to you whether what a library does is worth it weighed against whatever other drawbacks it may have
2014-12-04 23:43:39	wartech0	Rotaerk, well yea it kinda is
2014-12-04 23:43:44	wartech0	but you are making a 2d game?
2014-12-04 23:43:52	Rotaerk	haskell has mature opengl bindings, but the hogre library is labeled "experimental"
2014-12-04 23:43:54	wartech0	thats just a sprite batcher, maybe some simple shaders
2014-12-04 23:43:56	Slade	Rotaerk, you're too lazy to be an advocate.. make a game ;)
2014-12-04 23:44:10	Rotaerk	wartech0, yea I'd think so too
2014-12-04 23:44:17	Rotaerk	if I stick with 2D, I think I'll just use OGL directly
2014-12-04 23:44:31	DeM0nFiRe	I haven't looked at ogre or irrlicht in a while, but if I had to pick between irrlicht and ogre I would not pick ogre
2014-12-04 23:44:43	wartech0	I mean you are better off then I am, I am writing a realtime marching cubes implementation
2014-12-04 23:45:28	Slade	Rotaerk, spend an hour with irrlicht and an hour with ogre see what you can do

2014-12-04 23:49:44	Slade	Rotaerk, someones science experiment. but it'd get you started
2014-12-04 23:50:32	Rotaerk	anyway, libraries, languages, etc are an important decision, but they've never been the primary reason for me failing to make anything
2014-12-04 23:50:50	basehead	laziness?
2014-12-04 23:51:39	Rotaerk	well, more like I failed at the design process ... I obsessively go up scope creek
2014-12-04 23:52:26	Rotaerk	I spend days/weeks on mental masturbation, then a little coding, and then I get distracted with playing games and lose all interest in game development for a while
2014-12-04 23:53:00	Slade	there you go. just make it

2014-12-04 23:55:29	mantis	AND YOU'RE ONLY NOW UP
2014-12-04 23:55:48	Rotaerk	hmm lambdacube seems to be a purely functional abstraction over low level graphics api's like GL... *not* a graphics engine
2014-12-04 23:56:43	Slade	Rotaerk, toy. grab a real engine
2014-12-04 23:57:08	Rotaerk	hmm it has a mesh loading library
2014-12-04 23:57:39	@zao	Ooh, hotel breakfast has opened.

2014-12-05 00:01:58	Slade	Rotaerk, also checkout gamekit
2014-12-05 00:03:07	Slade	Rotaerk, are haskell -> c++ bindings hard?
2014-12-05 00:03:13	Rotaerk	never tried
2014-12-05 00:03:42	Slade	does haskell work in somewhat of a scripting system
2014-12-05 00:03:47	basehead	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaoO5cY1aHk
2014-12-05 00:03:48	basehead	is black magic
2014-12-05 00:04:05	Rotaerk	Slade, haskell is a compiled language; not interpreted, if that's what you're asking
2014-12-05 00:04:42	Slade	Rotaerk, no. i mean can you embed it in a c++ application easily
2014-12-05 00:06:33	Rotaerk	I don't know; I see that there's a GHC API *for* haskell
2014-12-05 00:06:35	@zao	Slade: I don't remember if you can embed GHC-sourced Haskell.
2014-12-05 00:06:44	Rotaerk	I don't see a GHC API for C++
2014-12-05 00:06:47	@zao	Slade: It definitely isn't elegant.
2014-12-05 00:06:52	@zao	If at all doable.

2014-12-05 00:07:13	Slade	your language is pretty weaksauce so far Rotaerk :P
2014-12-05 00:07:17	@zao	There may be some insane flavors of it like JHC, but it's not really that kind of gal^Wlanguage.
2014-12-05 00:07:26	@zao	Slade: It's not intended to be someone's bitch.
2014-12-05 00:07:29	Rotaerk	lol
2014-12-05 00:07:40	Rotaerk	haskell isn't lua
2014-12-05 00:07:56	Slade	lua/c#/python
2014-12-05 00:07:59	@zao	You want to embed something, grab a Scheme or the usual ones.
2014-12-05 00:08:18	@zao	The converse isn't that elegant either, as it's a boring old ffi.
2014-12-05 00:08:19	Slade	zao, nah Rotaerk wants to make a game with haskell 
2014-12-05 00:08:36	Rotaerk	the primary benefit of haskell is only meaningful when it's compiled
2014-12-05 00:08:37	@zao	Slade: I don't see how embedding follows.
2014-12-05 00:08:59	Slade	zao, cause theres no useful engines for him. i was wondering if he could grab something and just embed ;P
2014-12-05 00:09:27	Rotaerk	there *are* engines for haskell; ogre and irrlicht... and apparently lambdacube 3d; the primary issue is I'm not sure how mature they are
2014-12-05 00:09:40	Slade	those arent engines for haskell. someone wrote some bindings :P
2014-12-05 00:09:49	Rotaerk	well yes, but they're accessible to haskell
2014-12-05 00:10:27	Slade	so you treat it more like python. extend py instead of embed
2014-12-05 00:10:30	Rotaerk	in any case, for my purposes, OGL itself might be sufficient
2014-12-05 00:10:49	wartech0	http://i.imgur.com/iDVTstR.jpg < haha titled under "Multithreaded programming theory and practice"
2014-12-05 00:11:16	@zao	Slade: I don't like pythonistas that insist on "extend, don't embed", as that language is made to be bottom.
2014-12-05 00:11:31	@zao	They seem to have some "WE'RE NOT A SCRIPTING LANGUAGE" stigma.
2014-12-05 00:11:34	Slade	zao, sounds like thats what haskell is
2014-12-05 00:11:40	@zao	Slade: Definitely isn't.
2014-12-05 00:11:57	DeM0nFiRe	You could probably make a multithreaded joke about this, but mostly it's adorable and funny http://media.giphy.com/media/1HgenXUW6r8JO/giphy.gif
2014-12-05 00:12:05	Slade	zao, it definitly isnt "extend dont embed" 
2014-12-05 00:12:22	wartech0	zao I should go to #python and be like "yea I need help on the phython scripting language"
2014-12-05 00:12:35	wartech0	Watch the hate flow
2014-12-05 00:12:57	Slade	zao, that was a question
2014-12-05 00:12:58	@zao	Slade: It's not dynamic enough to have much purpose embedded.
2014-12-05 00:13:07	@zao	Both in typing and in when code builds.
2014-12-05 00:13:11	Slade	zao, ah its "i dont play well with others"
2014-12-05 00:13:30	@zao	It (assuming GHC), compiles up-front just like your average systems programming language.
2014-12-05 00:13:46	Slade	certainly an extend not embed then. you extend it with ogre bindings and what not
2014-12-05 00:13:54	@zao	It's not as much an "embedding" as "a bit of code to find out how to use those .obj files you linked in".
2014-12-05 00:14:21	@zao	You can drive the control flow from your C++, but you're not going to customize the code at runtime at all, nor introduce any types at runtime.
2014-12-05 00:15:05	@zao	Nor really, are you going to have much but rather opaque handles to values and types, most of your interaction will be through functions, not data.
2014-12-05 00:15:36	Mushu	zao: guh, does that hp microserver *not* come with screws for the drives?
2014-12-05 00:15:37	@zao	Your Haskelly bits would be more akin to a boring old library.
2014-12-05 00:15:39	Mushu	zao: I am upset
2014-12-05 00:15:42	@zao	Mushu: They're in the door.
2014-12-05 00:15:49	Rotaerk	hmm I believe haskell has standard library support for low level operations like the ones that are supported by the mechanisms of systems languages
2014-12-05 00:15:50	@zao	Mushu: Also has a little wrench for them.
2014-12-05 00:15:52	Mushu	what
2014-12-05 00:15:53	Mushu	omg
2014-12-05 00:16:03	Rotaerk	or rather, GHC does
2014-12-05 00:16:09	Mushu	holy shit
2014-12-05 00:16:13	Mushu	zao: I would not have found these
2014-12-05 00:16:15	wartech0	Rotaerk, hmm, why no c++ / opengl?
2014-12-05 00:16:28	Rotaerk	because I avoid C++ like the plague that it is :P
2014-12-05 00:16:32	Slade	zao, i dont know haskell, so just trying to genealize ;)
2014-12-05 00:16:43	wartech0	psh Rotaerk
2014-12-05 00:16:45	Slade	Rotaerk, sounds more like you let other people write in c++ for you
2014-12-05 00:16:57	Rotaerk	I'd only resort to C++ if I wanted to use a C++-specific framework
2014-12-05 00:17:26	wartech0	clearly you are inferior to my programming abilities, which makes you a lesser person (joking)
2014-12-05 00:17:26	@zao	Slade: So load the runtime, register modules with it, then get hold of function pointers and start calling into it with an opaque Env.
2014-12-05 00:17:45	@zao	Mushu: Hehe, I probably came upon them by accident.
2014-12-05 00:17:57	Rotaerk	wartech0, I know (or knew) C++ :P
2014-12-05 00:18:08	Rotaerk	well, as far as one can "know" it after a few years of using it
2014-12-05 00:18:21	Slade	zao, k
2014-12-05 00:18:22	Rotaerk	I just abandoned it in favor of more mature languages, a while ago
2014-12-05 00:18:23	wartech0	I pretty much only write things in C++
2014-12-05 00:18:31	wartech0	C++ is mature :P
2014-12-05 00:18:40	wartech0	its like a mature european cheese
2014-12-05 00:18:42	wartech0	some people love it
2014-12-05 00:18:45	wartech0	most people hate it
2014-12-05 00:18:47	Rotaerk	C++ is a dinosaur that is primarily useful because of its traction

2014-12-05 00:31:34	@zao	Tysmaker: If all you want to do is make small 2D games, Flash and its ecosystem is probably rather fine.
2014-12-05 00:31:44	Tysmaker	Well a game called castle crasher good game btw i asked them what they used to make the game and they said visual studio c++ and flash 
2014-12-05 00:31:54	@zao	Writing something analogous, even with "engines" in C++, is way more work.
2014-12-05 00:32:15	Tysmaker	i dont mind i just want to learn things like that 
2014-12-05 00:32:20	wartech0	well one
2014-12-05 00:32:29	wartech0	I would learn a programming language
2014-12-05 00:32:33	wartech0	devote a good year to doing that
2014-12-05 00:32:53	@zao	Tysmaker: Judging by some Bing searching, they made the game in Flash first.
2014-12-05 00:32:53	Tysmaker	i am currently learning c++ 
2014-12-05 00:32:55	wartech0	then, after that year if you still want to make games, be prepared to learn an API or library
2014-12-05 00:33:15	@zao	Tysmaker: And then implemented a reader for flash animations and objects and things in C++, to make it run on strange platforms like the 360.
2014-12-05 00:33:15	wartech0	that will take likely another year
2014-12-05 00:33:19	Mushu	hmm
2014-12-05 00:33:24	Mushu	I wonder how much power I'm drawing from this circuit
2014-12-05 00:33:29	@zao	So essentially reimplementing the parts of Flash themselves.
2014-12-05 00:33:34	wartech0	Mushu, lick it and find out
2014-12-05 00:33:35	Mushu	oh god
2014-12-05 00:33:36	Tysmaker	wait you can make a complete game jsut right out of flash i thought had to mix other programs with it to work 
2014-12-05 00:33:36	Mushu	zao: why
2014-12-05 00:33:48	@zao	Mushu: Wrap bacon around power cord as a canary.
2014-12-05 00:33:48	Mushu	wartech0: my tongue does not function as an ampmeter
2014-12-05 00:33:52	wartech0	Tysmaker, no..
2014-12-05 00:33:57	@zao	Tysmaker: Look at all the crap on newgrounds.
2014-12-05 00:33:59	wartech0	you can make games in flash
2014-12-05 00:34:01	wartech0	yea
2014-12-05 00:34:14	wartech0	still need to know actionscript
2014-12-05 00:34:16	 *	Mushu hopes nothing blows up
2014-12-05 00:34:21	Mushu	actually
2014-12-05 00:34:26	Mushu	lemmie turn off one of these first
2014-12-05 00:34:26	wartech0	but hell it might not be a terrible introduction to 'thinking like a programmer'
2014-12-05 00:34:43	@zao	Tysmaker: You've got things like Meat Boy (which was a fully featured flash game) and Super Meat Boy (a remake in C++).
2014-12-05 00:35:13	@zao	And Binding of Isaac (Flash with a thin wrapper to run standalone) vs. BoI: Rebirth (proper remake).
2014-12-05 00:35:16	Mushu	zao: don't forget binding of isaac (and rebirth)
2014-12-05 00:35:19	Mushu	:3
2014-12-05 00:35:40	Tysmaker	hmm okay i guess i have alot of work to do with flash then...
2014-12-05 00:35:51	wartech0	thats the thing
2014-12-05 00:35:58	wartech0	gamedevelopment is a lot of work
2014-12-05 00:36:06	wartech0	if it wasn't everyone would do it
2014-12-05 00:36:18	@zao	If you derive more pleasure from actual design and game making, it's probably a better venue to start off in than to put a couple of years into being C literate.
2014-12-05 00:36:22	Mushu	wartech0: pooping isn't a lot of work, but not everyone does it
2014-12-05 00:36:27	Tysmaker	ik that im already prepared for doing alot of work i like it...kinda
2014-12-05 00:36:44	Rotaerk	Mushu, wat.
2014-12-05 00:36:48	wartech0	Mushu, I hope everyone poops
2014-12-05 00:36:51	wartech0	otherwise
2014-12-05 00:36:54	wartech0	you will have issues
2014-12-05 00:37:15	wartech0	oh except for girls
2014-12-05 00:37:18	wartech0	they don't poop
2014-12-05 00:37:18	Rotaerk	I suppose there may be aberrations who don't poop
2014-12-05 00:37:19	 *	zao wobbles off in search of breakfast
2014-12-05 00:37:20	Rotaerk	like Washu

2014-12-05 00:37:59	Mushu	god this USB drive is so slow
2014-12-05 00:38:05	Mushu	I need to get some better ones
2014-12-05 00:39:36	@zao	"*through there"
2014-12-05 00:39:52	Tysmaker	what coding language does flash use? 
2014-12-05 00:40:07	@zao	Mushu: Try running OpenSolaris on USB stick.
2014-12-05 00:40:11	Rotaerk	isn't it actionscript?
2014-12-05 00:40:13	Mushu	wow, this thing has a discrete GPU?
2014-12-05 00:40:13	@zao	Or rather, proper Solaris.
2014-12-05 00:40:19	wartech0	Tysmaker, action script
2014-12-05 00:40:20	Mushu	zao: I'd rather not run Solaris :|
2014-12-05 00:40:24	@zao	Patching implies making a huge boot environment clone.
2014-12-05 00:40:28	Mushu	zao: and if I do, I'd rather run it on sparc.
2014-12-05 00:40:59	@zao	Mushu: Couldn't slice off an OS partition from the bulk storage, so USB sticks it was :)
2014-12-05 00:40:59	Mushu	I'm sad I never got my ultra sparc ii working
2014-12-05 00:41:05	Mushu	zao: lol.
2014-12-05 00:41:07	Mushu	that sounds terrible.
2014-12-05 00:41:12	@zao	Mushu: My Ultra10 still runs \o/
2014-12-05 00:42:16	Tysmaker	you can also make a main menu ui using flash right?
2014-12-05 00:42:41	wartech0	Tysmaker, yes
2014-12-05 00:42:56	@zao	Tysmaker: Anything you want to do with a bunch of sprites/shapes/text and manipulating those along curves or explicitly through code, you can do.
2014-12-05 00:43:19	@zao	Tysmaker: Try "researching" some on newgrounds, see what a competent (or less competent) person envisionably can do
2014-12-05 00:44:46	Tysmaker	what exactly does newgrounds help you with... 
2014-12-05 00:44:55	Tysmaker	infromation on how to do thigns right?
2014-12-05 00:46:05	Slade-	zao, what do you use for your games usually :)
2014-12-05 00:46:51	@zao	Slade-: I rarely get to making actual games, so mostly C++.
2014-12-05 00:46:53	@zao	Definitely not C#.
2014-12-05 00:47:03	@zao	Trying to wrap my head around idiomatic C, but it's hard.

2014-12-05 00:51:55	wartech0	C# is okay but up until recently it was very platform limited Slade- 
2014-12-05 00:52:05	wartech0	and thats why I think it has had trouble in adoption

2014-12-05 00:53:54	rajkosto	this is the guy who writes on post it notes
2014-12-05 01:07:37	@zao	Slade-: Language is fine for the people who can stand it.
2014-12-05 01:07:38	@zao	I can't.
2014-12-05 01:07:55	Slade-	zao, thats what i meant . you dont really like it for some reason :)
2014-12-05 01:10:30	@zao	In my eyes, it's a good Java.
2014-12-05 01:10:51	@zao	A bit crass, but it's got the same object obssessiveness, the same GC/Dispose shenanigans.
2014-12-05 01:11:28	@zao	And with things like LINQ and WPF, it's completely impossible to work with a program unless you've got serious perception damage.
2014-12-05 01:11:50	Slade-	perception damage?
2014-12-05 01:11:58	@zao	Was going to say brain, but that'd be a bit rude.
2014-12-05 01:12:02	 *	Slade- is a fan of both those things
2014-12-05 01:12:15	@zao	It requires so much faith in Modern Patterns and accepting your fate, I can't just.
2014-12-05 01:12:21	Vaayu	wait what, someone actually likes WPF?!
2014-12-05 01:12:29	Slade-	i dont use the linq syntax tho to be fair
2014-12-05 01:12:38	Slade-	Vaayu, yea. its like noncrappy html/css
2014-12-05 01:12:45	Vaayu	uh uh...
2014-12-05 01:13:00	Vaayu	let's not go down this road
2014-12-05 01:13:25	Slade-	Vaayu, your call. you opened it
2014-12-05 01:13:51	wartech0	lets instead talk about efficient terrain generation in a multithreaded way
2014-12-05 01:14:01	@zao	Slade-: I tried modifying Procurement recently.
2014-12-05 01:14:08	@zao	(an inventory management tool for Path of Exile)
2014-12-05 01:14:09	Slade-	zao, unfamiliar with procurement
2014-12-05 01:14:11	wartech0	lets instead talk about that multithreading bullshit
2014-12-05 01:14:13	Slade-	ok
2014-12-05 01:14:33	@zao	I had a very simple problem. The tool used the website to grab character and inventory data.
2014-12-05 01:14:43	Vaayu	wartech0: i've stopped handling terrain specially. just treat it as a triangle soup just like any other mesh in the scene
2014-12-05 01:14:46	@zao	It worked by setting the "current character" on the forums and scraping it.
2014-12-05 01:14:59	Slade-	sounds reasonable
2014-12-05 01:15:04	wartech0	Vaayu, actual generation of triangles will be done GPU side
2014-12-05 01:15:19	@zao	Slade-: My problem was that the program used lazy data sources, so the last character retrieved was the one that the website was left at.
2014-12-05 01:15:34	@zao	In particular, this led to the Game defaulting to a different character on startup.
2014-12-05 01:15:39	wartech0	basically a simple passthrough vertex shader, passing isocontours
2014-12-05 01:15:53	wartech0	then in the geometry shader I will use those to generate a marching cubes mesh
2014-12-05 01:15:54	@zao	It was properly impossible to modify the code to restore or order retrieves, as it was all a soup of DBO objects.
2014-12-05 01:15:56	wartech0	couple issues though
2014-12-05 01:16:06	@zao	Completely at the mercy of distributed control flow.
2014-12-05 01:16:14	Slade-	zao, DBO objects? wtf
2014-12-05 01:16:20	@zao	Slade-: I use the term loosely.
2014-12-05 01:16:26	@zao	I don't know all your fancy-ass terms.
2014-12-05 01:16:37	Slade-	it shoulda been a few simple calls to htmlagilitypack

2014-12-05 01:16:53	Slade-	which i'm guessing is the scraping lib they used
2014-12-05 01:17:00	@zao	Lazy synthesis of data by walking IEnumerables or IWankerDictionary or whatever the LINQ names are.
2014-12-05 01:17:07	@zao	Slade-: Scraping is not the point.
2014-12-05 01:17:26	@zao	The fact that the data access layer was modern and fancypants, completely prevented restoring sanity to it.
2014-12-05 01:17:38	wartech0	basically Vaayu, I need a job system for a my chunk generator
2014-12-05 01:17:57	Slade-	no. it prevented you and your skillset. an IEnumerable is basically just a stored foreach loop
2014-12-05 01:18:04	@zao	I know what the fuck an enumerable is.
2014-12-05 01:18:14	@zao	The point is, the control flow is such that you cannot fix the problem.
2014-12-05 01:18:36	Slade-	no, you cant. i sure can
2014-12-05 01:18:45	@zao	There's no place to sanely hook in the restore of previous state, as it's all a chain of mutating calls, hidden behind enumerables.

2014-12-05 01:19:10	@zao	Slade-: There is too much state to slurp down up front.

2014-12-05 01:19:17	@zao	Server is rate limited.
2014-12-05 01:19:38	Slade-	its all on a single page isnt it?
2014-12-05 01:19:41	@zao	Hell no.
2014-12-05 01:19:50	Slade-	2 pages? 5 pages?
2014-12-05 01:19:57	Slade-	how many server calls are needed to get your data
2014-12-05 01:20:14	@zao	AJAXy goodness, so hundred upon hundreds.
2014-12-05 01:20:44	Slade-	you're saying the app makes hundreds of calls to the server to retrieve character stats?
2014-12-05 01:20:57	@zao	The data was never intended to be machine readable.
2014-12-05 01:21:11	@zao	It's for people to interactively see their gear and stash data on a website.
2014-12-05 01:21:28	@zao	The tool scrapes this data, that was never intended as an API.
2014-12-05 01:21:35	Slade-	looking at the source to see this nonsense
2014-12-05 01:21:39	@zao	In particular, the selection of active character sticks.
2014-12-05 01:23:23	@zao	See stuff like the POEModel https://github.com/Stickymaddness/Procurement/blob/master/POEApi.Model/POEModel.cs
2014-12-05 01:24:07	Slade-	man they did this the hard way. anyhow i'm guessing the site remembers the last character selected on it
2014-12-05 01:24:28	@zao	I spent an evening to try to sort this problem out, which should be a few trivial lines of code in a sane approach.
2014-12-05 01:24:30	Slade-	which is probably what you were trying to explain
2014-12-05 01:24:31	@zao	This isn't sane.
2014-12-05 01:24:47	@zao	Now, breakfast and checking out.
2014-12-05 01:24:51	Slade-	well part of this is coder quality. part may be your unfamiliarity with the language
2014-12-05 01:25:13	@zao	Slade-: The thing is, any time I make a good effort to use the language, there's uncountable things kicking me in the nuts.
2014-12-05 01:25:37	Slade-	none of this is that bad either. just written way more elaborate than needed
2014-12-05 01:25:43	@zao	And VS is way too helpful in adjusting my code for me, and while a minor niggle, it's really annoying.
2014-12-05 01:25:55	@zao	And yes, you can probably "tune" that, but it's NOT HELPING.
2014-12-05 01:26:14	@zao	Language rules are fluffy and change every bloody time I try too.
2014-12-05 01:26:21	@zao	I could write C#1 perfectly fine.
2014-12-05 01:26:22	Slade-	so far havent seen a single lazy ienumerable :)
2014-12-05 01:26:25	@zao	5? Hell no.
2014-12-05 01:26:38	@zao	Slade-: Guy may have rewritten shit since I last tried.
2014-12-05 01:26:54	@zao	It's rather telling that not even he seems to be able to solve the problem at hand, having coded himself into a corner.
2014-12-05 01:26:55	Slade-	i cant even see a spot they'd be useufl so far
2014-12-05 01:26:58	@zao	Bug is completely untouched.
2014-12-05 01:27:47	Slade-	what would be quickest way to identify the proper character? first on the list? or requires a scrape of a new page?
2014-12-05 01:27:59	@zao	I also tried to add a button to the UI to copy a list of things into the clipboard.
2014-12-05 01:28:13	@zao	So many layers of data sources and implied bindings that I just could never get hold of the data.
2014-12-05 01:28:23	@zao	Without writing tons of WPF MVVM plumbing, or whatever you kids call it.
2014-12-05 01:28:47	@zao	No idea.
2014-12-05 01:29:01	Slade-	its mvvm should require 1 method. and a xaml snippet to make it work
2014-12-05 01:29:09	Slade-	to make a button
2014-12-05 01:30:04	@zao	In any way, everything here is probably trivial to someone like you with years of habits on the platform.
2014-12-05 01:30:07	Slade-	yea best way is probably to make a new call
2014-12-05 01:30:32	@zao	I just don't see any personal point in picking up a language and platform that does so much to aggravate, has properties I really don't want or need, and until rather recently, was utterly bound to a single vendor.
2014-12-05 01:30:52	Slade-	oh hes not even using mvvm
2014-12-05 01:31:06	@zao	I can't tell, it's all fragments of things and more XML than god.
2014-12-05 01:31:09	Slade-	oh hes partially using mvvm
2014-12-05 01:31:16	Slade-	wtf
2014-12-05 01:31:39	@zao	Slade-: I'm sorry for having you look at this wonderful piece of code :)
2014-12-05 01:32:18	Slade-	zao, eh. if you're learning the language this isnt a good place to start. but there are bad coders in any language.  openssl's source would put you off anything remotely related to c :P
2014-12-05 01:32:22	@zao	Maybe next time I get into the game, the author has fixed the problems. Not holding my breath tho.
2014-12-05 01:32:35	@zao	Slade-: Thing is, I've written novel things from scratch in the language too.
2014-12-05 01:32:38	Slade-	no i think it requires another code :)
2014-12-05 01:32:44	@zao	Including using stuff like SlimDX.
2014-12-05 01:32:46	Slade-	err another call
2014-12-05 01:32:51	@zao	It's just not compatible with my worldview.
2014-12-05 01:33:02	Slade-	dont know slimdx.. i used to use mdx which was awesome till msft killed it
2014-12-05 01:35:21	Slade-	anyhow, c# is a good tool. there are intricacies tho. and headspace things like accepting how little guarantee an IEnumerable gives you (because you can enumerate a network stream or a list or whatever)
2014-12-05 01:36:04	Rotaerk	IEnumerables are abused
2014-12-05 01:36:20	Rotaerk	for things that can only be enumerated once, IEnumerator should be used, but usually isn't
2014-12-05 01:37:08	Slade-	zao, one problem here is this guy basically did the same as writing his own game engine to write this. so everythign is done by hand :P
2014-12-05 01:37:30	Slade-	zao, either way. enjoy breakfasts :)
2014-12-05 01:38:33	Rotaerk	well nevermind, IEnumerator is designed poorly... built-in resetability assumption

2014-12-05 01:41:58	Slade-	ienumerator is just an interface man
2014-12-05 01:42:07	Rotaerk	I know
2014-12-05 01:42:28	Rotaerk	your point?
2014-12-05 01:42:32	Slade-	you've looked at RX?
2014-12-05 01:42:49	Rotaerk	reactive extensions? a while back, but I'm not really familiar
2014-12-05 01:43:20	Slade-	it moves the other direction. but rx has the nonretestable stuff  (tho you can wire up a 'recording' of sorts)
2014-12-05 01:43:32	Rotaerk	isn't RX just treating events as monads
2014-12-05 01:44:11	Slade-	its push notification of data. rather than pull
2014-12-05 01:44:24	Rotaerk	but that's called an event
2014-12-05 01:44:37	Slade-	cept events in c# arent that great
2014-12-05 01:44:56	Slade-	so yea its a more elaborate interface around it
2014-12-05 01:45:42	Slade-	my point was you could hook up an IObservable to anything because it doesnt have restart assumptions like IEnumerable.
2014-12-05 01:46:56	Rotaerk	IObservable would be an inappropriate substitution for IEnumerable in the case of something that cannot reset

2014-12-05 01:49:13	Rotaerk	I suppose it could be abused to represent an arbitrary sequence of values, but that's not really the intention of the observer pattern

2014-12-05 03:13:45	wartech0	yes please

2014-12-05 03:14:17	wartech0	well I have 4 unsigned bytes I am passing to my gpu
2014-12-05 03:14:34	wartech0	first 2 are isocontour values for marching cubes
2014-12-05 03:14:44	wartech0	so each corner can be 0-7

2014-12-05 03:15:31	wartech0	but thats only 16 possible values
2014-12-05 03:15:43	wartech0	and my chunks are 32 voxels in size...

2014-12-05 03:27:15	wartech0	hey zao
2014-12-05 03:27:33	wartech0	would you know of a way to 'draw' data in opengl
2014-12-05 03:27:37	wartech0	but the issue here
2014-12-05 03:27:42	wartech0	is that it isn't vertex data
2014-12-05 03:29:43	@zao	wartech0: Elaborate.
2014-12-05 03:30:02	@zao	Buffers are buffers, you can bind them to any kind of binding point.
2014-12-05 03:30:15	wartech0	well like I said each 'vertex' is actually isocontour values and position within a chunk
2014-12-05 03:30:33	wartech0	the geometry shader will actually handle construction of triangles
2014-12-05 03:30:47	wartech0	so would I just draw with GL_POINTS then?
2014-12-05 03:31:05	@zao	wartech0: GS expects some sort of input primitives, including ones with adjacency information.
2014-12-05 03:31:37	wartech0	yea it would be gl points in this example
2014-12-05 03:32:01	@zao	It can very well amplify any primitive type into any other (kind of) primitive type.
2014-12-05 03:32:01	wartech0	but I guess what I should say is that data is in no way shape or form triangle data
2014-12-05 03:32:16	@zao	So you could turn a point into a fixed count of triangles, or turn a triangle with adjacency into a point.
2014-12-05 03:32:31	wartech0	yes the former there
2014-12-05 03:32:38	wartech0	a point into a fixed count of triangles
2014-12-05 03:32:43	@zao	Map your data to one of the sanctioned primitive types, and then generate stuff from it.
2014-12-05 03:33:13	@zao	If you need adjacency, you may need the primitive types with adjacency, or read more information from a buffer/texture, if possible.
2014-12-05 03:33:25	wartech0	http://ideone.com/HNyc0i < I guess this would help

2014-12-05 03:36:06	wartech0	so basically zao I am feeding it voxels
2014-12-05 03:36:17	wartech0	and its using that information to construct an isosurface
2014-12-05 03:36:22	wartech0	(in the geometry shader)
2014-12-05 03:39:25	@zao	Zol: In sk?nska, does "bulle" mean "piece of bread"?

2014-12-05 07:05:37	QuantumP7	It's falling presents. You catch them in the stocking to score points. Very basic.
2014-12-05 07:06:37	arsl0nga	oh o.k. is it by clicking or swiping
2014-12-05 07:07:00	QuantumP7	Swiping.
2014-12-05 07:07:54	QuantumP7	Something Christmas themed to help people to waste time.
2014-12-05 07:08:03	arsl0nga	graphics couls be improved and the background as well. how close do you think you are to finish this?
2014-12-05 07:08:48	QuantumP7	I'd like to release it in the next 3 days.
2014-12-05 07:09:00	QuantumP7	Been working on it for 2.
2014-12-05 07:09:12	QuantumP7	It will probably be free, but ad-supported.
2014-12-05 07:09:43	arsl0nga	if you have the time i suggest you update the images and add a theme related background but keep it simple
2014-12-05 07:10:06	mikeman	i should finish my game too, but after work I'm burned out and not in the mood to code usually
2014-12-05 07:10:42	arsl0nga	the sock especially shows too much edges
2014-12-05 07:11:06	QuantumP7	Thanks, arsl0nga. Yeah, I'll definitely find another background. I tried to add some candy canes and gingerbread men to the background, but I felt that they cluttered the background too much.
2014-12-05 07:11:16	QuantumP7	Hmm. Ok, I'll work on the lighting.

2014-12-05 09:02:17	morr	Australia or Norway is >> France when it comes to how much it costs to live
2014-12-05 09:02:53	morr	Ah, London is the most expensive now apparantly
2014-12-05 09:03:29	Shadowdancer	I guess Paris has the ghetto belt dragging down the average
2014-12-05 09:03:33	@MikeP	yeah, I'm in NYC now, the cost of living here is pretty nuts
2014-12-05 09:03:45	Shadowdancer	but living there involves taking everything you want to keep with you to work
2014-12-05 09:03:52	@MikeP	I pay $2900 a month in rent :D
2014-12-05 09:03:58	Shadowdancer	o_O
2014-12-05 09:04:09	Sirisian|Work	That always cracks me up.
2014-12-05 09:04:43	@MikeP	I mean, that includes utilities, valet parking, concierge, and gym/pool/theater room access
2014-12-05 09:06:06	Shadowdancer	and every week a good ho drops by, courtesy of the landlord?

2014-12-05 14:35:06	@zao	ByteString is chunks of bytes, typically from UTF-8 encoding.
2014-12-05 14:35:13	@MikeP	most PC games just ship DDS files or some variant thereof 
2014-12-05 14:35:16	@zao	Text is UTF-16 in some sort of structure.

2014-12-05 14:35:31	@MikeP	but mobile games sometimes have some lossy compression to make distribution size smaller

2014-12-05 14:36:38	Purebe|Work	Then again it does suffer from loading screen sickness

2014-12-05 14:37:43	Slade	because thats a priority thing
2014-12-05 14:37:46	Rawr|Mac	but isn't dds supported by the GPU?
2014-12-05 14:37:54	Sirisian|Work	yes it's a container I think
2014-12-05 14:37:55	Rawr|Mac	like you can just barf DDS bytes into GPU memory
2014-12-05 14:38:11	Purebe|Work	Yep
2014-12-05 14:38:32	ajmiles	you don't really get to do that though
2014-12-05 14:38:34	Sirisian|Work	"The DirectDraw Surface container file format (uses the filename extension DDS), is a Microsoft format for storing data compressed with the proprietary S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) algorithm,[1] which can be decompressed in hardware by GPUs and consoles like the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360."
2014-12-05 14:39:03	@MikeP	DDS is just a container
2014-12-05 14:39:04	Sirisian|Work	kind of surprised the GPU doesn't offer a sampler shader.

2014-12-05 14:43:16	Sirisian|Work	Slade, Can you imagine if that exists. You shine light into a GPU and it goes through the device as optical signals outputting a fragment with a specific polarization for each pixel and then gets merged into a fiber optic cable and separated back out when it hits the monitor. That would be tight.

2014-12-05 14:47:23	Sirisian|Work	zao, well you'd probably compute the mip level in the fragment shader and then have custom mip textures in the custom format. Still though if that bgp takes such a large decoder I doubt it would fit cleanly into a fragment shader program for doing lookups with. Would be a cool toy project though.
2014-12-05 14:48:05	@zao	Sirisian|Work: I'm talking about my code, not your sillyformat.
2014-12-05 14:48:14	Sirisian|Work	fine
2014-12-05 14:48:46	Sirisian|Work	I mean sampling already has some overhead right? I remember doing a lot of samples years ago in a fragment shader. Like 100 of them and it was slow and I assume that's all using a hardware function in the GPU.
2014-12-05 14:48:55	Sirisian|Work	I wonder what the performance difference would be.
2014-12-05 14:49:17	ajmiles	Intel tried doing away with texture units

2014-12-05 14:49:59	Sirisian|Work	Are texture units still special? I assumed they were just buffers nowadays.
2014-12-05 14:50:34	ajmiles	you need something to decode all the possible formats and convert them into some other form (floats)
2014-12-05 14:50:52	ajmiles	+ do bilinear/trilinear/anisotropic filtering
2014-12-05 14:51:15	ajmiles	it'd be an awful waste of processing power to try and do all that in software

2014-12-05 14:59:06	Sirisian|Work	Well I think the decoder could be optimized a bit. Rather than decoding a whole texture it would be specialized to decode just a single fragment with bilinear filtering. Hopefully that could be done with no branching.

2014-12-05 14:59:44	Sirisian|Work	wavelet compression is generally okay for that assuming that's similar to that algorithm

2014-12-05 15:00:06	@MikeP	a "single fragment" accesses a lot of texels
2014-12-05 15:00:14	@MikeP	and if the format is compressed, you need the whole block
2014-12-05 15:00:36	@MikeP	and doing anisotropic filtering requires the derivatives...
2014-12-05 15:00:37	ajmiles	16x aniso could fetch 64 texels
2014-12-05 15:00:49	ajmiles	which could be, worst case (but unlikely) 64 cache lines
2014-12-05 15:01:38	Sirisian|Work	Well you can use custom textures for anistropic filtering. Though that that point it might be eating into the memory savings.

2014-12-05 16:51:45	Sirisian|Work	The rudder is a fin.
2014-12-05 16:52:00	Slade	SigMaulingMonkey, the rudder is a wing when you're flying at a 90 degree bank

2014-12-05 16:52:16	Slade	your rudder serves as your aileron actually
2014-12-05 16:52:54	ace4016	the vert stabalizer is wing; if it wasn't, it wouldn't stabalizer or allow ruddering :P

2014-12-05 16:54:01	ace4016	now i'm curious how the hell the B-2 yaws
2014-12-05 16:54:39	Sirisian|Work	ace4016, electric motors throttle are usually limited by the battery right?
2014-12-05 16:54:51	ace4016	what?
2014-12-05 16:55:11	Sirisian|Work	Like the maximum speed of the motor is limited to what the current the battery can produce right?
2014-12-05 16:55:19	ace4016	no
2014-12-05 16:55:49	ace4016	what happens when a battery isn't connected?
2014-12-05 16:55:58	Sirisian|Work	it doesn't spin
2014-12-05 16:56:12	ace4016	what if it was connected to a generator or some other power supply?
2014-12-05 16:56:42	ace4016	the limitation isn't quite a battery.  if you meant the current, then yes; you control motors via current control
2014-12-05 16:57:02	ace4016	though, depending on the motor, the current control can be different
2014-12-05 16:58:01	ace4016	for a brushed DC for example, a DC current is sufficient, and you can set a single, max current for the motor and just pulse it at various duty cycles for control
2014-12-05 16:58:06	Sirisian|Work	I guess if the batteries are in parallel that would give you a huge current.
2014-12-05 16:58:16	ace4016	not really
2014-12-05 16:58:17	Sirisian|Work	ah

2014-12-05 17:00:13	ace4016	battery voltage and current draw isn't ideal for most applications; usually you have something between the battery and teh load to condition the power to what you want (high voltage low current, low voltage high current, fixed voltage, fixed current, etc.)
2014-12-05 17:00:22	Sirisian|Work	I was thinking of powering a VTOL aircraft via flywheels for takeoff. Like charge flywheels for a type of afterburner and just release it into the engines for a very high current. I assume the wires wouldn't melt.
2014-12-05 17:00:35	Slade	i bet with a smart enough computer and enough props per wing you could even remove the need for a rudder :P

2014-12-05 17:02:02	ace4016	well, unless you were making a toy and wanted to be really simple in the design and not care about killing the battery, setting the battery on fire, or any sort of performance consistency
2014-12-05 17:02:28	Sirisian|Work	thus my idea of using flywheels to transfer power. Even out the demand on the batteries.

2014-12-05 17:10:56	ace4016	are you trying to take heat, turn it into rotational energy, to then turn it into electrical energy, back to rotational energy?
2014-12-05 17:11:30	Slade	ace4016, no trying to put a generator in the back and power 2-4 electric engines on the wings ;)
2014-12-05 17:11:42	Slade	rather. i'm considering the merits of it
2014-12-05 17:11:53	ace4016	Slade, notice my statement?
2014-12-05 17:12:37	ace4016	i'm doubtful you're going to get better performance going through that many conversion steps
2014-12-05 17:12:44	Slade	well heat isnt exactly correct. detonation. tho i guess its exothermic
2014-12-05 17:12:56	ace4016	heat+pressure
2014-12-05 17:13:09	ace4016	either way, count the convesion steps compared to now

2014-12-05 17:23:40	Sirisian|Work	not when they're spinning they create thrust
2014-12-05 17:23:45	 *	Sirisian|Work is smrt
2014-12-05 17:23:51	ace4016	they also create drag when they spin Sirisian|Work
2014-12-05 17:24:01	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: they create more thrust than drag
2014-12-05 17:24:04	ace4016	yes
2014-12-05 17:24:07	Slade-	They do. But if they are on the wing they are forcing the air on the wing to move faster
2014-12-05 17:24:08	Sirisian|Work	thus movement
2014-12-05 17:24:21	ace4016	but the fact that drag is still there doesn't go away
2014-12-05 17:24:26	Slade-	Stall is an aoa vs windspeed issue
2014-12-05 17:24:40	@KnightTemplar	Slade-: That assumes they force the air over the wing in a non-horrible fashion

2014-12-05 17:25:03	@KnightTemplar	and if you use the improved stall speed and lose a prop on takeoff, you die :P
2014-12-05 17:25:08	ace4016	yea, there's a lot about the "smaller, but more props are better" that i'm dubious about
2014-12-05 17:25:40	Slade-	ace4016: i am too. Interesting theories tho. 
2014-12-05 17:26:15	Slade-	When i get back to my pc i will link nasas test wing. Was like 14 props on a small wing
2014-12-05 17:26:16	Sirisian|Work	how inefficient are fans inside of a wing?
2014-12-05 17:26:34	Sirisian|Work	I assume someone has tried that as an alternative.
2014-12-05 17:26:38	ace4016	yes
2014-12-05 17:26:40	Slade-	Sirisian|Work: ducted fans are generally less efficient at cruise
2014-12-05 17:26:58	Sirisian|Work	well not ducted. Like giant thin disc fans
2014-12-05 17:27:04	ace4016	yes Sirisian|Work
2014-12-05 17:27:13	ace4016	there have been a shit ton of designs
2014-12-05 17:27:18	Sirisian|Work	I imagine. :P
2014-12-05 17:27:29	ace4016	there's even one that has a squirrel cage on the leading edge instead of props
2014-12-05 17:27:34	Slade-	They have more control at low speeds tho. Which us why quad copters use em
2014-12-05 17:27:38	Sirisian|Work	yeah saw that one
2014-12-05 17:28:50	ace4016	at low speeds, ducting improves on efficiency; at high speeds, the ducting improvements are for naught as the drag is much higher overall
2014-12-05 17:29:20	Slade-	Yea. Thats my concern with lots of props
2014-12-05 17:29:38	Slade-	Nasa wants to make most of the props tuck away during flight
2014-12-05 17:30:05	Sirisian|Work	yeah that seen that article. So cool.
2014-12-05 17:30:14	Slade-	And just use them all for takeoff and landing. Least thats one concept
2014-12-05 17:30:20	Sirisian|Work	terrafuga's TR-X design has that
2014-12-05 17:30:33	Slade-	Haha terrafuga
2014-12-05 17:31:02	Slade	they do understand the potential tho. i give them that
2014-12-05 17:33:28	ace4016	the tf-x doesn't fold anything away during flight
2014-12-05 17:33:57	Slade	ace4016, this has lots of interesting concepts about nasas belief and goals for distributed power. http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100036222.pdf

2014-12-05 17:34:50	Sirisian|Work	yeah, it has a more efficient fan in the back for cruise
2014-12-05 17:35:03	Slade	ace4016, yea they want to bring some extra engines just for take off
2014-12-05 17:35:24	Slade	http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120000856.pdf  <-- this is just on hybrid wing body
2014-12-05 17:36:40	ace4016	ah, confused the tf-x with something else
2014-12-05 17:37:19	Sirisian|Work	woah cool
2014-12-05 17:37:39	Sirisian|Work	This is pretty much what I imagined. Large delta wings with a lot of motors
2014-12-05 17:37:49	Slade	i dont think the hybrid wing body will do well for airliners
2014-12-05 17:37:55	Slade	the pax will reject it
2014-12-05 17:38:28	Slade	its probably suitable for GA tho :)

2014-12-05 17:41:51	Slade	or the plane is banking

2014-12-05 18:21:29	Promit	okay, sure, aviation is so so
2014-12-05 18:21:36	DeM0nFiRe	Heh, by 777 I assumed you meant http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081228210310/ibanez/images/a/af/JEM777_LG.jpg
2014-12-05 18:21:37	Promit	but you've gotta give it up for manila folders?
2014-12-05 18:22:11	@KnightTemplar	Promit: yeah, it's pretty cool from a 'building weird stuff' point of view
2014-12-05 18:22:30	ace4016	it has a jet engine with thrust reverses
2014-12-05 18:22:38	ace4016	which is kind of cool
2014-12-05 18:23:03	Promit	DeM0nFiRe, last time i played a jem i didn't understand why it cost 2k and not like, six hundred
2014-12-05 18:24:10	DeM0nFiRe	Heh, I've never played one. Though, there are some pretty nice looking jem-style guitar kits on ebay I have wanted
2014-12-05 18:24:45	Promit	basically ibanez doesn't make any guitars i like, which is sort of awkward
2014-12-05 18:24:48	Promit	same goes for PRS
2014-12-05 18:24:56	ace4016	you know...the "ask a question" section on amazon should really be a search engine for questions on the product, then, if the answer isn't there, allow it to be posted
2014-12-05 18:24:57	Promit	been meaning to try EBMM, haven't gotten around to it, but don't like what i've heard

2014-12-05 18:25:26	ace4016	because you end up with 50 of the same question, with 9 unique topics.
2014-12-05 18:25:31	DeM0nFiRe	Ibanez has a decent amount of guitars I'd like, but they are mostly too expensive
2014-12-05 18:25:41	ace4016	and people don't search because afaik they can't
2014-12-05 18:25:42	DeM0nFiRe	Most of their sanely priced models are pretty lame
2014-12-05 18:26:19	DeM0nFiRe	(Also what is even the difference between like 80% of their models?)
2014-12-05 18:26:49	DeM0nFiRe	Ibanez's RG series seems to have more models than any other guitar series, but less variation
2014-12-05 18:26:54	Promit	well i was in a "price almost no object" mood at the time, but it didn't help
2014-12-05 18:27:41	DeM0nFiRe	Well, even if price was no object, I could find stuff that I would end up liking more from someone else for less money
2014-12-05 18:27:56	DeM0nFiRe	But if they were more sanely priced some of them would be nice
2014-12-05 18:28:08	Slade	ace4016, wonder how you could ho about intelligently devving a uav capable of long flight
2014-12-05 18:28:09	@KnightTemplar	Promit: If price is no object buy a Geddy Lee J-bass and send it to me along with whatever else you buy :/
2014-12-05 18:28:17	Promit	basically i don't like shallow, flat back necks - they give me hand cramps
2014-12-05 18:28:35	Promit	KnightTemplar, you implied you basically don't play bass anymore
2014-12-05 18:28:43	ace4016	Slade, make a glider?
2014-12-05 18:28:48	@KnightTemplar	I know
2014-12-05 18:28:58	@KnightTemplar	But then I'd have sexy bass to not play :/
2014-12-05 18:29:01	Sirisian|Work	ace4016, extremely stiff. My dad used it for all of his wings.
2014-12-05 18:29:02	Slade	ace4016, sure big aspect ratio. but then the electronics and guidance becomes more interesting
2014-12-05 18:29:22	Sirisian|Work	after the hot air it becomes like a hard plastic

2014-12-05 18:30:01	Slade	KnightTemplar, i was thinking guidance being the biggest challenge to a civy
2014-12-05 18:30:06	@KnightTemplar	I think it comes with the custom shop pickups

2014-12-05 18:30:18	@KnightTemplar	Slade: Guidance? No, there's plenty of literature on that

2014-12-05 18:30:38	Slade	KnightTemplar, i mean it'd be out of radio contact. it'd need gps probably
2014-12-05 18:30:44	@KnightTemplar	Slade: They sell those
2014-12-05 18:30:53	@KnightTemplar	Also, why would it be out of radio contact?

2014-12-05 18:44:31	Slade	yea tech class doesnt even require morse code anymore
2014-12-05 18:44:32	Sirisian|Work	Not sure why you'd use radio. You have 3g and 4g antennas. Buying a t-mobile sim card you can prepay for data and just throw it in a cellular breakout board. Cell latency is rather small.
2014-12-05 18:44:38	@KnightTemplar	err... 1500 W
2014-12-05 18:44:49	@KnightTemplar	I don't think any of them require morse code

2014-12-05 18:45:19	@KnightTemplar	I did morse code when I got my extra
2014-12-05 18:45:30	ace4016	Sirisian|Work, guess what 3g and 4g use?
2014-12-05 18:45:33	Slade	thats what.. 30wpm for extra?
2014-12-05 18:45:45	@KnightTemplar	back in the day it was something like that
2014-12-05 18:45:49	Slade	oh, and your UAV has to have a license too i think
2014-12-05 18:45:53	@KnightTemplar	nope
2014-12-05 18:46:09	Slade	or broadcast as your license ;P

2014-12-05 18:48:18	Slade	tho some towers are beginning to shield upwards
2014-12-05 18:48:26	ace4016	shield?
2014-12-05 18:48:36	Slade	prevent signal from coming/going that way
2014-12-05 18:48:37	ace4016	as in prevent from broadcasting upward?

2014-12-05 18:48:56	Sirisian|Work	yeah 3 direction towers tend to do that. They're really good at controlling the beams.

2014-12-05 18:55:24	Slade	ace4016, skyvector.com
2014-12-05 18:56:06	Slade	i mean. easiest would be to stay out of b,c,d space.. you're not going to a...
2014-12-05 18:56:32	@KnightTemplar	Slade: And MOAs, and restricted areas, and prohibited areas
2014-12-05 18:56:56	Slade	doesnt need to stay out of moas. but maybe smart to avoid all special use airspace
2014-12-05 18:57:11	ace4016	hrm, where on the page does it tell you the airspace code or whatever?
2014-12-05 18:57:13	Slade	i mean you might lose your uav to a high speed f22... but
2014-12-05 18:57:25	Slade	ace4016, whats the color of the circle aroudn you
2014-12-05 18:57:31	Slade	and is it dotted
2014-12-05 18:57:36	Slade	or does it seem to be out of all circles
2014-12-05 18:57:54	ace4016	two red concentric circles
2014-12-05 18:58:09	@KnightTemplar	are they purple or red?
2014-12-05 18:58:12	ace4016	solid lines
2014-12-05 18:58:17	ace4016	red
2014-12-05 18:58:24	Slade	oh you're in a tfr
2014-12-05 18:58:27	@KnightTemplar	lol
2014-12-05 18:58:41	Slade	you've got a security problem int he area
2014-12-05 18:58:54	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: What's the airport?
2014-12-05 18:58:58	Slade	those are temporary and you're not supposed to fly 
2014-12-05 18:58:59	ace4016	wait, wrong place
2014-12-05 18:59:13	Slade	oh actually thats DC you're talking about
2014-12-05 18:59:24	Slade	yea you're in trouble in DC :p
2014-12-05 18:59:38	ace4016	KnightTemplar, KNKT is the closest airport to me, physically
2014-12-05 18:59:48	ace4016	closest public one is EWN :P
2014-12-05 18:59:55	@KnightTemplar	http://vfrmap.com/?type=vfrc&lat=34.903&lon=-76.881&zoom=10
2014-12-05 19:00:26	@KnightTemplar	lol... wilmington has a TRSA?
2014-12-05 19:00:27	@KnightTemplar	wtf?
2014-12-05 19:00:55	Slade	ace4016, so the dashed blue line, you need to fly above that. at least to 2501 feet. maybe best to stay away
2014-12-05 19:01:14	@KnightTemplar	and stay out of the hashed blue line R-5306 A)
2014-12-05 19:01:16	@KnightTemplar	A :)
2014-12-05 19:01:23	Slade	dont fly northeast, or south west :P
2014-12-05 19:01:40	Slade	west is your best bet. thats basically e space
2014-12-05 19:01:41	Slade	and g
2014-12-05 19:01:44	ace4016	i believe i'm within the dotted blue :P
2014-12-05 19:01:51	@KnightTemplar	And the alert area is a bad place to fly
2014-12-05 19:01:59	ace4016	so i'd have to leave home to fly
2014-12-05 19:02:01	@KnightTemplar	Unless you enjoy getting hit by military jets
2014-12-05 19:02:19	ace4016	(yes, i live really close to base :P)
2014-12-05 19:02:21	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: the dashed blue line that surrounds NKT?
2014-12-05 19:02:41	Slade	ace4016, no. you'd need to get permission
2014-12-05 19:03:03	Slade	ace4016, you can contact the tower and they can let you into restricted areas (not prohibited)
2014-12-05 19:03:06	ace4016	heh, flying around the tree tops is fine
2014-12-05 19:03:19	@KnightTemplar	Slade: No they can't
2014-12-05 19:03:31	ace4016	not sure what i'd do higher than that unless i need it for a project
2014-12-05 19:03:32	@KnightTemplar	ATC cannot authorize non-participating aircraft to enter restricted areas
2014-12-05 19:03:39	@KnightTemplar	We are not the controlling agency
2014-12-05 19:03:43	Slade	KnightTemplar, no you cant. pilots have a different frequency to call
2014-12-05 19:04:04	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: You can't fly even at treetop level in the NKT Class D airspace
2014-12-05 19:04:15	ace4016	ah....well damn :P
2014-12-05 19:04:34	Slade	KnightTemplar, for 5306A ace4016 would need to contact 124.1 to get permission
2014-12-05 19:04:45	@KnightTemplar	I mean, you could call NKT tower and ask them if you can fly a model airplane in their delta
2014-12-05 19:04:47	ace4016	yea, you're not getting permission Slade...
2014-12-05 19:04:53	@KnightTemplar	and they'll probably say "w/e, stay away from our airplanes"
2014-12-05 19:05:19	ace4016	i live fairly close to an approach
2014-12-05 19:05:19	Promit	and then get in trouble with FAA
2014-12-05 19:05:29	ace4016	Promit, the marine copr
2014-12-05 19:05:29	Slade	ace4016, actually its pretty common to be allowed through
2014-12-05 19:05:33	ace4016	corp*
2014-12-05 19:05:48	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: Planes don't fly at treetop level tho'
2014-12-05 19:05:54	ace4016	they don't :P
2014-12-05 19:05:54	@KnightTemplar	So if you're < 500', they probably don't care
2014-12-05 19:05:57	Slade	ace4016, i've flown through restricted areas in texas near bases.
2014-12-05 19:06:00	@KnightTemplar	unless you live right off the runway end
2014-12-05 19:06:12	ace4016	KT, eh...cutting it close :P
2014-12-05 19:06:53	Slade	ace4016, surprisingly you have no prohibited airspace around
2014-12-05 19:07:03	sinclair	so, im seriously considering buying a motorcycle ace4016 
2014-12-05 19:07:07	sinclair	thoughts?
2014-12-05 19:07:10	Promit	you'll die
2014-12-05 19:07:22	ace4016	sinclair, do it; buy a helmet and crash jacket
2014-12-05 19:07:35	@KnightTemplar	Promit: Everyone told me that, and I haven't died yet
2014-12-05 19:07:35	ace4016	or whatever they're called
2014-12-05 19:07:50	sinclair	ace4016: the space suits?
2014-12-05 19:07:58	Slade	ace4016, you've got a freaking lot of moas around there too
2014-12-05 19:08:08	ace4016	moas?
2014-12-05 19:08:13	@KnightTemplar	Slade: Cherry Point MCAS is right there :P
2014-12-05 19:08:18	ace4016	that acronym means something else
2014-12-05 19:08:21	ace4016	to me
2014-12-05 19:08:34	Slade	ace4016, military operations area
2014-12-05 19:08:40	@KnightTemplar	and New River MCAS
2014-12-05 19:08:42	Slade	think thats what it means
2014-12-05 19:08:45	ace4016	yes...i work on base :P
2014-12-05 19:08:53	ace4016	i live really close to it too
2014-12-05 19:09:00	sinclair	ace4016: unless he means the large flightless (extinct) NZ bird (emu / ostridge)
2014-12-05 19:09:11	ace4016	hehe
2014-12-05 19:09:12	Slade	ace4016, i figured that. but i mean if you go to the west you just have this other region there
2014-12-05 19:09:30	ace4016	there are a lot of military bases around these here parts

2014-12-05 19:10:16	ace4016	on some roads, if you're not careful, you'll have a bomb falling on you, bullets raining either down at you  or parallel to the ground, and you can potentially be ran over by a tank :P
2014-12-05 19:10:17	sinclair	whatcha think?
2014-12-05 19:10:25	Slade	ace4016, for reference i did get sort of denied access into a prohibited area once.. they were like "we are in the middle of a live fire exercise right now.. but if you want...."
2014-12-05 19:10:36	ace4016	sinclair, i know very little about bikes
2014-12-05 19:10:40	@KnightTemplar	Slade: Prohibited means prohibited :)
2014-12-05 19:10:47	Slade	err sorry restricted

2014-12-05 19:11:12	Slade	KnightTemplar, we have george bushes ranch not to terribly far from us. thats the closest prohibited i've been to
2014-12-05 19:11:17	@KnightTemplar	And you actually can get clearance into it
2014-12-05 19:11:20	@KnightTemplar	From the USSS

2014-12-05 19:11:35	sinclair	ace4016: i always thought of myself as a bit of a ninja, (a js ninja), so riding a kawasaki ninji cycle "just makes sense"

2014-12-05 19:11:54	ace4016	Slade, heh; they do live fire exercises in the waters around here...fisherman get notice to avoid the area...some skirt the outside because the fish/shrimp know the bombing locations are safe from fisherman

2014-12-05 19:12:23	Slade	dubais is insane.
2014-12-05 19:12:30	@KnightTemplar	There is no straight flight section before landing
2014-12-05 19:12:34	@KnightTemplar	it's a continuous turn
2014-12-05 19:12:39	Promit	hey that's near here
2014-12-05 19:12:42	Promit	i could be there in half an hour
2014-12-05 19:12:53	Slade	KnightTemplar, wtf is that
2014-12-05 19:12:59	@KnightTemplar	Amazing
2014-12-05 19:13:08	ace4016	lol
2014-12-05 19:13:31	@KnightTemplar	Try flying it in FS, it's a pain in the butt
2014-12-05 19:13:51	ace4016	what base is that?
2014-12-05 19:14:32	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: It's Martin State, MD (not a base)
2014-12-05 19:14:35	@KnightTemplar	ohhhhh
2014-12-05 19:14:36	@KnightTemplar	I see
2014-12-05 19:14:39	@KnightTemplar	that's brilliant!
2014-12-05 19:14:45	ace4016	lol
2014-12-05 19:14:59	ace4016	i saw the Military Operations Only thing
2014-12-05 19:15:02	@KnightTemplar	The 1500-10000' shelf of the BWI class B airspace is 12 DME

2014-12-05 19:15:43	Promit	plus the airport isn't even that nice
2014-12-05 19:15:44	ace4016	ah, joint military/civil airport
2014-12-05 19:15:44	@KnightTemplar	Where does it say military operations only?
2014-12-05 19:16:02	@KnightTemplar	oh, I see
2014-12-05 19:16:11	ace4016	maybe that's just one runway
2014-12-05 19:16:39	@KnightTemplar	oh, no
2014-12-05 19:16:41	Rotaerk	Slade, you have to pass through nullsec to get to dubai?
2014-12-05 19:16:50	ace4016	Rotaerk, yes
2014-12-05 19:16:53	@KnightTemplar	ace4016: so you see how the runway is 6997' long?
2014-12-05 19:17:04	@KnightTemplar	and there's a what appears to be some taxiway at the end?
2014-12-05 19:17:16	ace4016	yea
2014-12-05 19:17:17	@KnightTemplar	for military operations that extra 1000' is usable landing/takeoff apparently
2014-12-05 19:17:41	ace4016	AH!
2014-12-05 19:17:50	ace4016	btw, i suck at reading approach plates

2014-12-05 19:18:39	ace4016	might work with the pilots on an approach plate project...
