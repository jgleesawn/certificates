2014-12-02 14:34:17	KytheraMike	Yeah, when you see an AI fly off through the level boundary or hit an asteroid, it may well be because its thrusters are damaged so it doesn't have much control any more
2014-12-02 14:36:11	Miki	Or the AI caused the pilot to black out.
2014-12-02 14:36:48	AzraelDomonov	When Matt says the splines for advanced AI are dynamically generated, does he mean that they are dynamically chosen from a list of known manuvers by the AI pilot, or are new splines generated on the fly?
2014-12-02 14:38:18	KytheraMike	Splines are selected from known maneuvers and then copied in front of the ship to fly from where it currently is

2014-12-02 14:41:44	HUGGIESroxFace	Will all NPCs choose from the same pool of splines, or are there different pools for different pilot skill levels (E.g: Elite NPCs will know/use more maneuvers than a civilian pilot)?
2014-12-02 14:42:33	AzraelDomonov	Cool. Seems like a way that devs can add personality to a certain AI character by having it selected from a restricted group of splines. Certain pilots (or aliens) might prefer a type of manuver over others. The splines seem to be a really cool way to impliment that.
2014-12-02 14:43:59	KytheraMike	Yep, different NPCs select from different sets of splines to help give them personality, and for difficulty

2014-12-02 14:47:39	Miki	Assuming all of the AI is simulated serverside.
2014-12-02 14:50:07	phildunstan	KytheraMike: Is the AI all server-side? Is there a single player version of the game running on a users PC or is it all massively multiplayer online?

2014-12-02 14:58:26	HUGGIESroxFace	When I play Vanduul Swarm, I tend to get up and close with my target. Because of this, I commonly get sprayed by in the rear by the "friendly" AI. Is there a plan to implement some discretion for AI wingmen so they don't engage when another player/npc is within their field of fire?
2014-12-02 15:00:32	KytheraMike	Interesting, we do have a check against friendly fire, but maybe we should suppress fire over a wider volume around the friendly
2014-12-02 15:00:46	totallytroy	sounds like a plan ... :)
2014-12-02 15:02:29	totallytroy	I agree completely

2014-12-02 15:03:30	hgjgjh	Hello Azrael
2014-12-02 15:03:50	Miki	Indeed. This is very easy to follow for those that know what they're doing.
2014-12-02 15:05:08	Miki	So those Leaf() calls are referring to other predefined behaviors I am guessing?
2014-12-02 15:08:04	KytheraMike	Yeah, those Leaf calls are mostly BT nodes that perform an action (such as rolling)

2014-12-02 15:10:16	Miki	How does the RCC++ usage affect performance though?
2014-12-02 15:14:30	KytheraMike	It doesn't make any significant difference to performance, because the modified functions are linked in replacing the original implementation.  The areas of the code that use RCC++ were structured to use it from the beginning which helps
2014-12-02 15:16:34	Miki	Does it compile into native code?

2014-12-02 15:41:40	AJC	see the RTC++ website
2014-12-02 15:41:55	Apocx	Is their AI in the FPS gamemode? Can they take cover and reliably move around in a zero-G environment? Since obviously the navmesh wouldn't me quite as useful
2014-12-02 15:42:07	test78	Persistent Universe relevant: how deep is the AI simulation going to be for enemy ships like the Vanduul on capships, are you just simulatinug the turrets or also the crew manning the turrets, i.e. in view of possible impact from hull breach etc.

2014-12-02 15:52:49	martyj-o	?
2014-12-02 15:52:56	Miki	Like a JIT compiler I'd assume.
2014-12-02 15:52:59	martyj-o	How can it possibly allow you to change it in real time?
2014-12-02 15:53:08	martyj-o	Also, why would you *want* to?
2014-12-02 15:53:29	AJC	martyj-o: it recompiles and loads a new DLL.
2014-12-02 15:53:39	martyj-o	It seems very strange to me.
2014-12-02 15:53:40	AJC	because it's faster than script and you can apply it to existing code
2014-12-02 15:53:45	dougbinks	Yes, it's a compiler. For more see the presentation Matthew and I did on the site.
2014-12-02 15:53:50	Miki	Also because native code.

2014-12-03 18:44:19	AJC	amitp: what happened in September? :-)
2014-12-03 18:45:27	amitp	I met Bret Victor, Ken Perlin, Vi Hart, and a few other smart people. I learned a lot about teaching and explanations. I started seeing things that I was missing .. things I wasn't even thinking about when writing my tutorials.
2014-12-03 18:47:15	amitp	So now everything I write, I'm flooded with my brain telling me all the things I need to check, the things I'm missing, etc.
2014-12-03 18:48:01	amitp	I've been trying to "level up" my explanation skills, and I got to meet people who've beat hard mode. So now I'm trying and failing :-) but it just means I need to try harder!
2014-12-03 18:48:45	amitp	I decided I'll try some simpler topics. Right now, linear interpolation. Super simple topic. I'll practice my writing and interactive diagrams with this, and work my way back up.
2014-12-03 18:49:42	AJC	Bret held a workshop, was it that?
2014-12-03 18:49:47	amitp	Yeah
2014-12-03 18:50:09	AJC	I don't know Vi.
2014-12-03 18:51:30	amitp	One thing Vi told me was that in my tutorials, I have the reader set up the inputs (such as the graph, or the start/end points for pathfinding), but then I run the algorithm. What if the reader ran the algorithm? Wouldn't you learn the algorithm better by stepping through it yourself instead of the tutorial just giving you the answer? That made me go HMMMMMM
2014-12-03 18:52:31	AJC	wha struck me earlier this week, is how much time it takes to make a great tutorial
2014-12-03 18:52:45	AJC	and from a purely busines perspective it's impossible to justify over the quality of a text or video
2014-12-03 18:52:46	amitp	It takes me 2-4 months typically for one page
2014-12-03 18:52:53	AJC	hehe
2014-12-03 18:53:03	amitp	Yeah, I can't justify this at all from a business perspective, and don't even try.
2014-12-03 18:53:10	AJC	our MCTS tutorial was similar but with a few people at the same time rather than spread out
2014-12-03 18:53:14	AJC	i do try :-)
2014-12-03 18:53:50	amitp	Yep :-)
2014-12-03 18:54:03	martyj-o	AJC: You banned me the other day for no reason. However, by so rudely doing so, you made me want to GIVE a reason. So... you are a retarded faggot nigger slut who eats donkey farts for breakfast.
2014-12-03 18:54:05	amitp	On the other hand, as a reader, I much prefer text over video, so that's what I end up producing

2014-12-03 18:54:39	AJC	amitp: i've decided to do more creation and have the educational experienced as a side effect
2014-12-03 18:55:31	amitp	The ai sandbox tutorial looked like a huge amount of work
2014-12-03 18:55:40	amitp	What kind of creation?

2014-12-03 18:56:44	@AJC	i'm more interested in pushing boundaries these days, i've done a lot of "documentation" work ? maybe too much
2014-12-03 18:56:49	amitp	AI Sandbox seemed like such a great setup. You have a tutorial showing the concepts, and how that connects to code. And then you let the reader try it out and build their own thing, starting from something simple that works. I really liked that structure
2014-12-03 18:57:07	amitp	Cool
2014-12-03 18:57:11	@AJC	it's also one that's hard to justify business wise, but it's going somewhere.
2014-12-03 18:57:19	@AJC	we're working on opening up the code more

2014-12-03 18:59:54	amitp	I'm impressed that you've gotten aigamedev to work, because I've been fairly pessimistic about business opportuntities around tutorials/teaching. But I guess a few others made it work too. Gamedevtuts seems successful. Gamedev.net is one of the earliest sites and is still around. Ray Wenderlich has lots of stuff.
2014-12-03 19:00:05	amitp	I'm pessimistic about most things though ;)
2014-12-03 19:00:23	AJC	gamedev.net has traffic, that makes it easier to monetize
2014-12-03 19:00:27	AJC	from forums, etc.
2014-12-03 19:00:57	AJC	gamedevtuts from Envato?
2014-12-03 19:01:14	AJC	if so, those guys are insane
2014-12-03 19:02:43	amitp	I assume you're insane too ;)
2014-12-03 19:03:07	amitp	They were willing to pay me $150 per article but since it takes me at least a month to write one, it wasn't something that'd work for me
2014-12-03 19:03:30	AJC	that's slavery
2014-12-03 19:03:49	AJC	I wrote technical articles for Intel at 1,000 EUR each, and wouldn't consider less for unique content
2014-12-03 19:03:58	AJC	for blog post spam maybe
2014-12-03 19:04:01	amitp	Yeah
2014-12-03 19:04:14	AJC	you could push them up easily, that's just their default offer.
2014-12-03 19:11:12	amitp	I look at how much I'd make if I just got a job and think writing will never make that much ;)
2014-12-03 19:12:29	amitp	Distributing the articles for free gets a lot of people to read them, and that leads to lots of job offers.

2014-12-03 21:42:28	Apocx	I'm trying to wrap my head around using a matrix to shear some vertices in a mesh and it's kicking my ass :P
2014-12-03 21:42:39	Apocx	My matrix skills have always been pretty weak

2014-12-03 21:49:45	Apocx	I've actually already gotten it working by just rotating the vertices with a matrix, but it doesn't preserve the width of the line segment that way.
2014-12-03 21:49:52	Apocx	http://i.imgur.com/LIGczxi.png
2014-12-03 21:50:13	Apocx	So maybe I should just stick with that a figure out how much I need to scale it by to get the width correct
2014-12-03 22:14:04	Apocx	Holy crap that worked :D
2014-12-03 22:14:15	Apocx	It's so damn convoluted but hey, it works
2014-12-03 22:15:24	Apocx	I transformed a vector with a length equal to the line width by the rotation matrix I setup, and then Dotted that against the line's width vector. then 1f/dot = scale. and I added the scale to the matrix and transformed the points. now it preserves width. :P
