2014-11-21 16:49:39	sarseo	well... as i understood it, QA is important in video games as opposed to business apps.  a lot of polishing/cleaning goes into games in general, not just code, but everything
2014-11-21 16:49:59	sarseo	i say that, and yet, lots of half-assed games get released nowadays. -_-

2014-11-21 17:07:41	BlackFox	you can't fix all bugs until the date, so the game will ship with them

2014-11-21 17:18:14	KillerJim	Shot in the dark, but does anyone have a nice C++ (Java or JS would do) A* path finding algorithm that can handle cube worlds (or cube nodes) and terrain like tunnels, bridges, etc?
2014-11-21 17:18:54	-->	Frens (~frens@tm.84.52.164.43.dc.cable.static.telemach.net) has joined #gamedev
2014-11-21 17:19:04	sarseo	dat A* pathfinding...
2014-11-21 17:19:20	sarseo	so widely used, yet never a convenient lib handy. -_-
2014-11-21 17:19:37	paultech	KillerJim:  Pathfinding depends highly on how you store things to be able to iterate over
2014-11-21 17:19:58	paultech	So no clear cut solution if you already store objects and you dont want to duplicate it
2014-11-21 17:20:16	paultech	but otherwise, A+ is easy, well documented and finding reference material is child's play 
2014-11-21 17:20:19	BlackFox	sarseo, it's not cause of QA time
2014-11-21 17:20:25	BlackFox	it's because programmers don't have enough time
2014-11-21 17:20:31	BlackFox	they simply don't have enough time to fix all QA bugs
2014-11-21 17:20:40	paultech	2d you may want some type of axis-aligned bounding array like a quad tree
2014-11-21 17:20:43	BlackFox	you have to pick only the game breaking ones, and try to fix those in time
2014-11-21 17:20:46	paultech	3d something like a kd-tree, pointed would be good
2014-11-21 17:20:52	BlackFox	if a glitch doesn't break or crash the game, it's not high priority
2014-11-21 17:21:16	sarseo	a tree of kraft dinner...
2014-11-21 17:21:21	paultech	I don't have formal QA. I build tests and just hand out my game till I get the feedback I need
2014-11-21 17:21:22	sarseo	mmmmm
2014-11-21 17:21:26	paultech	I dont ever publish release dates
2014-11-21 17:21:42	sarseo	in the fall, it rains ketchup
2014-11-21 17:21:55	paultech	Hows the ADD meds working out for you buddy
2014-11-21 17:22:13	sarseo	psssh, it's friday... i take a break from meds
2014-11-21 17:22:25	sarseo	cept the very special kind
2014-11-21 17:22:36	paultech	those are the good ones

2014-11-21 17:24:15	sarseo	BlackFox, i dunno dude... that /sounds/ like "QA time" (which is identify as "time spent on quality assurance").  "game-breaking" bugs i guess would fall under normal development time, but i think some gamers would lump "bugs" in with their evaluation of "quality"
2014-11-21 17:24:51	sarseo	not having "time" to fix "QA" bugs != "QA time"?
2014-11-21 17:25:03	BlackFox	QA will find you every bug your game has, but programmers have to finish the game AND fix the bugs
2014-11-21 17:25:17	sarseo	ah k, well that's where i made the mistake.  i assumed fixing bugs = QA.
2014-11-21 17:25:22	BlackFox	No
2014-11-21 17:25:29	BlackFox	QA is finding bugs, fixing bugs is part of programming
2014-11-21 17:25:38	BlackFox	Same programmers who will write the game will also fix the bugs while writing the game
2014-11-21 17:25:40	sarseo	k, well i meant that latter part
2014-11-21 17:25:59	sarseo	especially considering i've never had the two separate.  i've always had to test my own apps. -_-

2014-11-22 02:21:00	stoopdapoop	same here
2014-11-22 02:21:09	boredDev	I'm more looking to make a game. I'm more about game design than programming.
2014-11-22 02:21:37	newguise1234	what kind of game do you want to play
2014-11-22 02:21:40	newguise1234	err, make
2014-11-22 02:21:51	boredDev	well, 2d would be easiest
2014-11-22 02:21:56	newguise1234	would playing chrono cross or some other game be inspiring?
2014-11-22 02:22:09	newguise1234	legend of mana?
2014-11-22 02:22:22	boredDev	it's been awhile since I played chrono cross. I remember it getting a little trippy.
2014-11-22 02:22:23	newguise1234	play something sprite based that still has a storyline that draws you in?
2014-11-22 02:22:42	newguise1234	get inspired, then craft a story of your own?
2014-11-22 02:22:42	boredDev	legend of mana? is that similar or related to secret of mana?
2014-11-22 02:22:50	boredDev	I'm not good with stories.
2014-11-22 02:22:51	newguise1234	I think I meant secret of mana
2014-11-22 02:23:00	newguise1234	I only played the first hour or so of it
2014-11-22 02:23:05	newguise1234	but I liked the feel of it
2014-11-22 02:23:06	boredDev	I actually have a game design concept, but it might be a little too deep for me.
2014-11-22 02:23:12	boredDev	I hated the feel.
2014-11-22 02:23:33	newguise1234	mm
2014-11-22 02:23:39	boredDev	I like the game, the mechanics are iffy, but I hated the fact that screen push was on the edges, so you couldn't really see where you were walking.
2014-11-22 02:23:46	newguise1234	secret of mana is essentially legend of mana 2, it seems
2014-11-22 02:23:59	newguise1234	word, I like walking around and using my sword
2014-11-22 02:24:08	newguise1234	more of a legend of zelda feel than a final fantasy feel
2014-11-22 02:24:29	newguise1234	:/
2014-11-22 02:24:33	boredDev	oh, I enjoy realtime combat (action style)
2014-11-22 02:24:44	newguise1234	legend of mana is the 3rd or fourth in the series
2014-11-22 02:24:50	newguise1234	secret of mana is the 2nd
2014-11-22 02:24:53	boredDev	combat systems like ff are nice, but they tend to be a bit grindy.
2014-11-22 02:24:57	newguise1234	aye
2014-11-22 02:24:57	Axord	I like some implementations of both.
2014-11-22 02:25:13	Axord	Zelda's a nice target.
2014-11-22 02:25:31	newguise1234	I didn't play ff8 much, but I think they had time limited choices in their combat
2014-11-22 02:25:32	boredDev	it is, but I don't have any interesting ideas to do for a game like that.
2014-11-22 02:25:40	newguise1234	I think if you had a game mechanic where it was real time combat
2014-11-22 02:25:52	newguise1234	but you could "pause" for short timed intervals to cast spells
2014-11-22 02:26:00	newguise1234	it would still have an intensity of real time combat
2014-11-22 02:26:17	newguise1234	and would require you to have a certain level of skill to navigate spells properly to get the one off you wanted
2014-11-22 02:26:26	boredDev	hmm.
2014-11-22 02:26:53	boredDev	there's a game for ps vita that I've recently played that uses a match 3 system that I think is pretty neat.
2014-11-22 02:27:21	boredDev	I also thought of a match 3 game design recently, but I noticed some flaws in the mechanic that I'm not sure how I would resolve.
2014-11-22 02:28:28	boredDev	I thought to use some type of screen tilt (targeting mobile platforms), but I don't like the idea of a game where the accelerometer is integral to the gameplay.

2014-11-22 02:29:12	Axord	boredDev: what is the vita game?
2014-11-22 02:29:17	newguise1234	excite truck did it well for their steering
2014-11-22 02:29:34	boredDev	it's called no heros
2014-11-22 02:29:38	boredDev	or something like that.
2014-11-22 02:29:53	Sail	I think I'm not very good at the math.. but! I'm having trouble keeping a few objects all within the camera view
2014-11-22 02:29:58	boredDev	no heros allowed.
2014-11-22 02:29:59	Sail	Any ideas? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dda13a07ce22b112f2c4
2014-11-22 02:30:32	boredDev	oh. Sail. 3d is a little beyond me atm.
2014-11-22 02:30:48	Sail	Thats cool! I guess I'm in the same boat ;)
2014-11-22 02:31:27	boredDev	sorry newguise1234, it's "No Heroes Allowed: no puzzles either"
2014-11-22 02:31:45	newguise1234	thats pretty much all that came up when I searched for no heroes vita lol
2014-11-22 02:32:08	boredDev	ah, you added vita. apparently for the psp, there was a no heroes allowed, but it looks quite different.
2014-11-22 02:32:18	boredDev	and may only have been in japanese
2014-11-22 02:32:43	boredDev	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHxRf98dcbM
2014-11-22 02:33:00	boredDev	the last level seems almost impossible to beat.
2014-11-22 02:33:22	newguise1234	Sail: whats going wrong?
2014-11-22 02:33:27	boredDev	collecting all the monsters and heroes is a bit grindy.
2014-11-22 02:34:08	newguise1234	word, it looks interesting enough
2014-11-22 02:34:38	Sail	newguise1234: Its zooming out too much, and then in some cases, not enough

2014-11-22 02:35:15	newguise1234	when you tell it to move? or is this just happening sporadically
2014-11-22 02:35:27	Sail	I have a feeling its line 35 thats giving it trouble, and I've been trying a few things but I still haven't worked out
2014-11-22 02:35:29	Sail	Yep
2014-11-22 02:35:51	newguise1234	what is _cameraDistance used for?
2014-11-22 02:36:41	newguise1234	Sail: I would probably toss some parens around your divisions
2014-11-22 02:37:02	Sail	_cameraDistance is the height of the camera from the players
2014-11-22 02:38:20	Sail	I think its just the height / width thing thats an issue. when I just use width, it scales fine, but doesn't keep take the height (Z axis distance) into consideration, unfortunately
2014-11-22 02:38:37	newguise1234	are you trying to get a head bob motion or something?
2014-11-22 02:39:05	Axord	Interesting.
2014-11-22 02:39:27	Sail	Nah, just trying to get the camera to pull away to ensure that all characters are visible on the screen at once
2014-11-22 02:39:41	newguise1234	I'm sorry I'm lost, I pretty much only understand how my camera works in relation to the objects in my program :/
2014-11-22 02:39:47	newguise1234	ohh
2014-11-22 02:40:15	Sail	I'm probably going about this the worst way possible, all I wanna do is keep all the players visible haha
2014-11-22 02:40:45	boredDev	I think I'll make a stupid arkanoid.
2014-11-22 02:40:48	newguise1234	scale your width and height based on the aspect ratio
2014-11-22 02:40:54	newguise1234	then take the maximum of the two values
2014-11-22 02:41:01	newguise1234	and scale your camera distance by that
2014-11-22 02:42:46	Sail	Ahhhhyepo

2014-11-24 13:21:43	paultech	newguise1234: BVH?
2014-11-24 13:22:43	paultech	Bullet itself stores the bodies in a efficient manner (Depending on solver, broadphase you use). You should store your game objects in a way thats quick to lookup also but don't kill yourself with optimizing it too much at this stage.

2014-11-24 13:23:49	newguise1234	paultech: bounding volume heirarchy, I did see that bullet used it someplace but I didn't keep reading at the time.  Usually used for static environments or such.
2014-11-24 13:24:12	newguise1234	I'm not sure if its possible, but my thought was to use a bounding cube for basic collision, the broad sweep
2014-11-24 13:24:47	newguise1234	but then create a BVH for each model, essentially allowing broad sweep efficiency while checking for collisions between faces of an object
2014-11-24 13:25:00	paultech	Yep that's no problem. You just create a shape in the bullet world describing your object 
2014-11-24 13:25:10	newguise1234	cool
2014-11-24 13:25:24	paultech	Are you needing static meshes to collide? They don't in bullet unless you handle them
2014-11-24 13:25:49	paultech	Rigidbodies are what simulate physics from bullet -> game. Static are game -> bullet where we update bullet on its position
2014-11-24 13:25:58	paultech	Rigidbodies, we get told from bullet where to go
2014-11-24 13:26:37	newguise1234	I'm not sure what I'll need, I guess I'm just (spouting is the wrong word) trying to set forth what I've been thinking about over the past couple days.
2014-11-24 13:26:49	paultech	Ideally the simple way is use MotionStates - If in C++ you can inherit Motionstate and its two simple callbacks to manage physical updates, bullet even interpolates for you
2014-11-24 13:27:27	newguise1234	I think I understand though
2014-11-24 13:27:39	newguise1234	if I wanted, I could write a static mesh collision handler.
2014-11-24 13:28:12	newguise1234	if I did so, I would probably use Bounding Volume Heirarchies to implement it.  Due to that being the most efficient algorithm I know
2014-11-24 13:28:18	paultech	You have a gameobject, that gameobject has a bullet body, the body has a shape. Bullet only ever gets told about the body. If its rigid it will call the object once at startup asking "Whats my start location" from then on it will call the object with the new interpolated position that you can set the object gameobject too
2014-11-24 13:28:34	paultech	Well - Bullet handles static collisions fine, you just have to implement the logic of what should happen
2014-11-24 13:29:15	newguise1234	k, I think it would work out better and I'd misinterpret what you're saying less if I dove into bullet lol.
2014-11-24 13:29:28	newguise1234	to the extent of my understanding, what you're saying is making sense though
2014-11-24 13:29:35	paultech	yep! It's the best way 
2014-11-24 13:29:39	paultech	What are you coding in ?

2014-11-24 13:31:19	newguise1234	I pretty much have a glmodel manager and a renderer that interacts with that
2014-11-24 13:31:31	paultech	Do you have the concept of gameobjects ?
2014-11-24 13:31:34	newguise1234	and takes in object position/orientation and viewport

2014-11-24 13:33:05	paultech	make the gameobject inherit from btMotionState and have a btRigidBody pointer. When you create a object, create the shape (Box, sphere etc), then create the body from that shape. When setting the motionstate set to your gameobject then its just two methods to implement to have working physics!
2014-11-24 13:34:13	paultech	getWorldTransform(btTransform &) - is called once for rigidbodies to get start position, setWorldTransform is called to give you the new position to set your object too

2014-11-24 13:36:00	newguise1234	will I be moving to btVectors then?
2014-11-24 13:36:08	newguise1234	or do they play well together
2014-11-24 13:36:09	paultech	nah, just convert between them
2014-11-24 13:36:41	newguise1234	thats nice, I was able to do the same with the PointCloudLibrary I'm using
2014-11-24 13:36:59	newguise1234	I might be able to forgo that now though, we'll see
2014-11-24 13:38:05	paultech	Nice, I have a simple vector class that converts between the different types I use for me
2014-11-24 13:38:18	paultech	but you could even use btVector everywhere, its a great vector math lib
2014-11-24 13:39:33	newguise1234	cool, the pcl was just a wrapper around a float[4], so I was just *(glm::vec4 *)&PointXYZ and vice-versa lol

2014-11-24 13:39:53	paultech	You also have collision filtering to worry about later on, If you have two objects type that can't collide setting filtering for them gets them eliminated as collision pairs very early in the broadphase. First thing to optimize when you get into large amounts!
2014-11-24 13:40:10	newguise1234	nice
2014-11-24 13:40:15	paultech	That works just fine! Most vectors are just a fancy wrapper around a simple array
2014-11-24 13:40:34	paultech	btvector included
2014-11-24 13:40:57	paultech	its just btScalar[4]
2014-11-24 13:41:06	paultech	btScalar can be float or double depending on flags passed

2014-11-24 17:58:31	waressearcher2	when something is called "level editor", does that mean it can only allow you to creata rooms and put textures on the walls, or it also allows you to import objects write scripts to interact with those objects and all other features that you can use to make a complete playable level ?
2014-11-24 17:59:17	newguise1234	depends on how you separated everything, but I would go with the latter
2014-11-24 17:59:18	waressearcher2	so a "level editor" is a more generic name of full featured game editing software and not just designing look and feel of rooms in games ?
2014-11-24 17:59:27	newguise1234	and possibly call it a scenario editor or something of that ilk

2014-11-24 18:02:05	paultech	in my engine, i just toggle between dev mode and game mode. In dev mode I can select objects to move them, edit scripts and save the scene. game mode I move around and the physical world is active
2014-11-24 18:02:05	paultech	you'll see that im a fan of stupid simple? :)
2014-11-24 18:02:05	paultech	its got a few bonuses, one you are assured that placement is correct since its happening in-engine

2014-11-24 18:02:05	paultech	Since the physics engine is there, you can test out different shapes and sizes to get the reaction you need in real time 
2014-11-24 18:02:53	paultech	Can be done either using a state system with a dev state, a simple bool, preprocessor define. however you feel like it!
2014-11-24 18:02:53	paultech	and it happens naturally for me, i add more features to dev mode as I put them into game mode
2014-11-24 18:03:13	paultech	also means the format I save to is pretty optimal since there is no conversion needed from some external format

2014-11-24 22:45:23	newguise1234	it also only supports up to opengl 2.1 and the demos use opengl 3, so I'm kind of floundering right now

2014-11-24 22:48:08	paultech	so for now, bullet2 is what you want!
2014-11-24 22:48:12	newguise1234	k, thats kind of what I was gathering, I hadn't gotten it working, but I was seeing some(what looked like) non opencl libraries

2014-11-24 22:48:33	newguise1234	I had played around with opencl some months ago on my desktop
2014-11-24 22:48:43	paultech	yep keep in mind bullet3 and bullet2 share a repo and are packaged together, in cmake disable BUILD_BULLET3
2014-11-24 22:48:58	newguise1234	so I am excited for that type of acceleration, combined with shared gl buffers
2014-11-24 22:49:04	newguise1234	but atm, I need non-opencl lol
2014-11-24 22:49:06	newguise1234	cool
2014-11-24 22:49:24	paultech	Yep but well optimized physical simulation can occur on CPU, CPU's are pretty awesome now a days

2014-11-25 01:21:37	paultech	Good on ya! I like SDL, found SFML easier to use but its getting rather old in its opengl  
2014-11-25 01:21:44	paultech	(non-core, mostly immediate mode)
2014-11-25 01:22:16	phao	I see.
2014-11-25 01:22:51	phao	Seems like a cool game concept. For geeks =D
2014-11-25 01:23:02	phao	paultech, sfml's support for opengl isn't that great?
2014-11-25 01:23:09	phao	I never used sfml...

2014-11-25 01:23:37	paultech	phao:  The game does have combat/medic class that are less geeky! SFML OpenGL support is fine, its just not optimal if you plan to do anything very intensive graphically
2014-11-25 01:23:46	paultech	for 2D, SFML is great, modern C++ interface
2014-11-25 01:24:16	phao	I didn't know something like SFML could impede "optimal" usage on opengl.
2014-11-25 01:24:33	newguise1234	chime in: old-school opengl is immediate mode.  A lot of discrete calls that the driver uses.  Modern opengl uses shaders and takes advantage of an optimized pipeline.
2014-11-25 01:25:22	paultech	Correct ^. Immediate is the older OpenGL pipeline that refuses to die, Its extremely easy to use and most opengl devs get started on it
2014-11-25 01:25:47	paultech	But the modern pipeline is much more efficient and if you want modern effects you'll need it
2014-11-25 01:26:09	newguise1234	the nehe tutorials I've read use immediate mode.  Things like glBegin(); glVertex(); glEnd();
2014-11-25 01:26:21	paultech	But engines like Unreal, Unity have moved to Core profiles with little to none immediate mode
2014-11-25 01:26:41	paultech	Yea, I like http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/ personally
2014-11-25 01:26:54	newguise1234	arcsynthesis.org/gltut has an intro that helped me pipelines and modern gl
2014-11-25 01:27:05	newguise1234	I've heard good things about opengl-tutorial as well though
2014-11-25 01:27:05	paultech	Teaches about immediate mode but then quickly moves on from it

2014-11-25 05:31:40	roxlu	hi, I???m working on some code to do super smooth tweening and I was wondering if someone around has looked into that before.  My biggest doubt is if I should use system-time or frame-count as the time basis. I know with physics simulations one would use system time and make sure the game time and physics timers are nicely in sync  (e.g. like Gaffer On Games describes).  Though with non-physics based animations, like tweening functions I??
2014-11-25 05:31:41	roxlu	not sure if this is the best solution. My guts tell me that using frame count is more suited for this. Anyone who wants to share some thoughts on this?

2014-11-25 06:02:15	stoopdapoop	any advice?
2014-11-25 06:02:26	stoopdapoop	is it really hard to become employable?
2014-11-25 06:02:29	L-Spiro	From what country are you?
2014-11-25 06:02:33	stoopdapoop	United States
2014-11-25 06:03:30	L-Spiro	It?s a loaded question.  It depends on what you can deliver.
2014-11-25 06:04:02	L-Spiro	Or rather what they can determine that you can deliver.
2014-11-25 06:05:03	stoopdapoop	hmmm
2014-11-25 06:05:28	stoopdapoop	if you don't mind me asking, what would be some examples of what you can deliver?
2014-11-25 06:05:39	stoopdapoop	just examples, doesn't really have to be about you, but what would be considered a deliverable?
2014-11-25 06:06:06	L-Spiro	Keeping it real, I mess up, just like anyone else.
2014-11-25 06:06:18	L-Spiro	I will show you one of my mistakes.  Hold on.
2014-11-25 06:06:27	stoopdapoop	if I can write a screen space raytracer (for specular reflcetions) that's fairly quick, would that get my foot in the door?

2014-11-25 06:08:09	stoopdapoop	yeah
2014-11-25 06:08:26	L-Spiro	It resulted from my own custom AA technique.
2014-11-25 06:09:02	stoopdapoop	oh, does it depend on depth discontinuities?
2014-11-25 06:09:35	L-Spiro	I don?t remember what the hell I was doing, but I know it did not take depth into account at all.
2014-11-25 06:09:43	stoopdapoop	haha, I see
2014-11-25 06:10:29	L-Spiro	Your question was about how to get a job in graphics programming.
2014-11-25 06:11:16	L-Spiro	I showed this same flaw to Square Enix during the interviews.
2014-11-25 06:11:21	L-Spiro	they loved it.
2014-11-25 06:11:34	stoopdapoop	hmmm
2014-11-25 06:11:39	L-Spiro	Why? 
2014-11-25 06:12:02	stoopdapoop	sorry, just means I'm thinking
2014-11-25 06:12:04	stoopdapoop	that's interesting
2014-11-25 06:12:17	L-Spiro	Because my resume shows 11 years of experience, which raises the bar, but I show flawed demos, which makes me still human.
2014-11-25 06:12:48	L-Spiro	If you don?t have years of experience, don?t show them flaws.

2014-11-25 06:25:56	L-Spiro	If you want to get a job in graphics.  Show everyone on paper how much you know more about graphics than they do.
2014-11-25 06:25:57	stoopdapoop	not that I would
2014-11-25 06:26:11	L-Spiro	I moved to Japan.
2014-11-25 06:26:19	stoopdapoop	on paper? like research papers?

2014-11-25 06:26:33	L-Spiro	Everything you can get.

2014-11-25 06:30:36	L-Spiro	It?s far more impressive to say, ?I came up with this AA algorithm, but it has this flaw, and I?m working on that.?
2014-11-25 06:31:18	L-Spiro	No.  They put academics in another category.

2014-11-25 10:59:51	King_DuckZ	hm idk, my argument is that platform diversity makes your code better, so it was useful to have a full-time windows guy
2014-11-25 11:01:10	King_DuckZ	besides, speaking of games, say you're starting a new project, you have 3 programmers working each on linux/mac/win
2014-11-25 11:01:23	King_DuckZ	you basically have the three versions for free from the very beginning
2014-11-25 11:01:35	Brend	I'm pretty sure that's never how it happens
2014-11-25 11:02:43	King_DuckZ	I know, then companies end up having to do crazy changes in the middle of development, like changing the build system, or paying third party companies to do crap ports of games they don't care about
2014-11-25 11:03:58	King_DuckZ	and in the latter case, their development is still windows-centric, so the next game they have to pay all over again

2014-11-25 11:06:14	Brend	Well, that, but also making the thing work in the first place, not to mention build systems and content pipelines and installers and updaters and so on
2014-11-25 11:07:10	King_DuckZ	well steam addresses some of that
2014-11-25 11:08:02	King_DuckZ	doing the right thing (ie not getting stuck in anything too specific) from the begginning addresses something else
2014-11-25 11:09:05	King_DuckZ	making it work, if you have one dev per platform is way cheaper, they test stuff as they develop the game, one by one instead of having to fix it all in one go at the end

2014-11-25 11:09:54	Brend	Sure. but ask yourself why, for instance, Unity can build for Linux but the studio won't run there
2014-11-25 11:09:59	Brend	(Same with UE4, I think)
2014-11-25 11:10:42	Brend	Also do you really want every dev to have to spend half their time doing platform support
2014-11-25 11:10:57	Brend	Especially when in practice you're only going to ship any units on one platform, and it's Windows
2014-11-25 11:11:11	King_DuckZ	idk... but I can tell you there's ppl that still think you have to provide different binaries for each distro... -_-
2014-11-25 11:12:04	King_DuckZ	and that came from the owner of a company the whose only business is porting games to mac, and was looking to expand into the linux world

2014-11-25 11:17:43	King_DuckZ	well steam only provides one binary which is 32 bit, afaik, then packagers from other distros modified it to add it to their repos

2014-11-25 11:25:09	Brend	So here's one of the seven billion (all different) threads about this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2247842
2014-11-25 11:25:09	Brend	(Note that that guy's problem turned out to be a totally different one than mine)
2014-11-25 11:25:09	Brend	The fact that it worked for you doesn't mean anything -- it's worked out of the box for me on two computers too. And not on a third. All running 64-bit Mint.
2014-11-25 11:26:43	King_DuckZ	Brend: blame ati for making crap drivers - I won't buy anything from ati ever again
2014-11-25 11:27:36	King_DuckZ	unfortunately many hardware vendors decide to toss crap drivers at linux users if any at all, so you have to select the hardware you buy

2014-11-25 11:32:31	King_DuckZ	sorry but that's true for all platforms, you're just looking at it as a skilled windows user
2014-11-25 11:32:54	King_DuckZ	I suck at windows and thus I always run into problems with it, more than the average user
2014-11-25 11:33:19	Brend	So first, the solution to that guy's problem was "run as administrator".
2014-11-25 11:33:55	Brend	Second, if you're claiming that the frequency of problems running Steam on Windows is within *two orders of magnitude* of Linux, then you're either crazy or trolling
2014-11-25 11:34:18	Brend	And third I only run Windows to play games, Linux has been my primary desktop basically forever.
2014-11-25 11:34:39	King_DuckZ	I'm saying that every platform has its own issues

2014-11-25 11:35:44	newguise1234	Linux fanboy here.  I do have issues getting things to work on linux, more so than on windows.  But I prefer it this way, because most of the issues you can actually find out why it isn't working
2014-11-25 11:35:53	newguise1234	yes most of the time its some obscure configuration problem
2014-11-25 11:36:03	newguise1234	which sucked up hours of your time and thats really not pleasant
2014-11-25 11:36:11	newguise1234	but on windows I get little to no feed back

2014-11-25 11:37:05	Brend	I don't know, at the end of a configuration problem hunt I haven't usually actually learned anything except how to fix that specific configuration problem
2014-11-25 11:37:10	Brend	(Which I later discover broke three other things)
2014-11-25 11:37:53	newguise1234	I find that to be the case as well, and its not really pleasant

2014-11-25 11:38:15	newguise1234	I guess it ends up pruning the software I use to a small batch that doesn't have issues when run together
2014-11-25 11:38:26	newguise1234	and I like the minimal amount of stuff I have installed
2014-11-25 11:39:24	newguise1234	I am also using tinycore which I boot from the cd and run in ram, so anything that breaks my system, I can just reboot for a "fresh install"
2014-11-25 11:39:41	newguise1234	so my setup wouldn't necessarily be what anyone else is looking for
2014-11-25 11:40:09	newguise1234	but I find the confines help me out
2014-11-25 11:41:26	Brend	Yeah I mean we're finally at the point now where I can basically buy a computer, put Linux on it, and have a reasonable expectation of being able to run a shell, emacs, and a web browser without days of bullshit
2014-11-25 11:41:31	newguise1234	it also makes me think of, what should my game require so that when people want to play it, they don't have headaches getting it to work
2014-11-25 11:41:54	Brend	Although actually display emacs has issues on my desktop in Mint (weird flickering and shit) but not on my laptop
2014-11-25 11:42:03	Brend	Worked fine on the desktop in Ubuntu
2014-11-25 11:42:24	newguise1234	are there other graphics differences between the two?
2014-11-25 11:42:26	Brend	("display emacs"? emacs has display issues)
2014-11-25 11:42:30	newguise1234	do they use different drivers?
2014-11-25 11:42:35	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-25 11:42:44	Brend	Both Nvidia cards, with the same (proprietary) drivers. Different cards, obviously

2014-11-25 11:43:00	Brend	But the same card in my desktop -- a 560ti -- had never given me any problems previously, through like four different distros
2014-11-25 11:43:03	newguise1234	thought it was the same machine, different boots
2014-11-25 11:43:08	Brend	And then suddenly in mint 16 boom! Issues.
2014-11-25 11:43:37	newguise1234	compare the xorg.conf?
2014-11-25 11:43:45	newguise1234	haha, entering the rabbit hole
2014-11-25 11:43:53	newguise1234	I'm not going to go further than this lol
2014-11-25 11:43:55	Brend	It's been ten years since I opened xorg.conf and I have no desire to break that streak ever

2014-11-25 11:45:52	newguise1234	I guess the sentiment I was trying to get across earlier is that, yes it requires remembering stuff but, LD_LIBRARY_PATH makes more sense to me than configuration menus in windows
2014-11-25 11:46:49	newguise1234	thats probably from learning I had to use it in linux before having to deal with an analogous situation in windows though

2014-11-25 11:52:18	Brend	I don't know, I think Windows is probably worse overall on this one, especially now that it does that thing where it stores basically a complete image of all your DLLs on every update and that ends up being 300% the size of the actual thing you're running
2014-11-25 11:52:40	Brend	On the other hand its equivalent of LD_LIBRARY_PATH is to, you know, just copy all the .dlls into the executable directory
2014-11-25 11:52:47	Brend	Which is ... intuitive? Maybe?
2014-11-25 11:52:50	newguise1234	lol
2014-11-25 11:53:07	newguise1234	well, you'll have everything directly at your fingertips :p
2014-11-25 11:53:31	Brend	You can do the same on Linux but the results are *much more surprising and complex*!
2014-11-25 11:53:37	newguise1234	haha
2014-11-25 11:53:52	newguise1234	it could allow dll injections on a per-program basis that wouldn't affect other programs
2014-11-25 11:53:59	newguise1234	not sure thats what they're going for lol
2014-11-25 11:54:22	Brend	I think that basically is what they're going for
2014-11-25 11:54:36	Brend	The solution to DLL Hell is to make sure every program can have any combination of libraries it feels like, simultaneously
2014-11-25 11:54:48	newguise1234	new vector of attack, target the copy program instead of the dll
2014-11-25 11:54:55	newguise1234	when it copies the dlls have it inject the code?
2014-11-25 11:55:32	newguise1234	if they just use the regular copy program, then it might be not that great of an idea lol
2014-11-25 11:56:18	Brend	Whereas on Linux all you need is a file called README.cpi: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Nov/74

2014-11-25 12:40:20	King_DuckZ	apparently it's deprecated... but anyway its purpose is to quit when malloc fails, which /could/ include the case of malloc(0)
2014-11-25 12:40:56	King_DuckZ	if that's true, then the example in your link will make the program quit right before writing out of bounds
2014-11-25 12:41:21	King_DuckZ	though I couldn't test the outcome of xmalloc() myself :/

2014-11-25 13:52:49	paultech	At that point the hobby is collecting games.. not playing them :)

2014-11-25 13:57:28	sarseo	eleuin, bitchin'!
2014-11-25 13:57:41	sarseo	you're a collector?
2014-11-25 13:57:51	eleuin	haha, not really xD
2014-11-25 13:57:55	sarseo	XD
2014-11-25 13:58:08	DragonRift	paultech: I had a shit load of Playstation games too but when I was 26 I lost all my games yet again in a house fire
2014-11-25 13:58:08	eleuin	i wish i had the monies
2014-11-25 13:59:13	DragonRift	paultech: it was after this that I swore I would only ever buy games electronically anymore
2014-11-25 13:59:24	paultech	hehe good move
2014-11-25 13:59:41	DragonRift	I lost nearly 2000 psx/ps2 games
2014-11-25 13:59:49	eleuin	you can probably download/pirate alot of your old games you used to own for the older systems
2014-11-25 14:00:02	eleuin	(pirating isn't technically illegal if you already own the games)
2014-11-25 14:02:08	Madsy	It is, at least if you seed
2014-11-25 14:02:17	DragonRift	I try not to support that mentality as a game dev though
2014-11-25 14:02:21	DragonRift	I rather be legitimate
2014-11-25 14:02:57	DragonRift	ever since I lost all my games last, I have only ever baughten games on steam
2014-11-25 14:03:00	Madsy	And making a bacup copy is rarely or never the same as downloading a version from the internet
2014-11-25 14:03:01	eleuin	i own a physical copy of SMB, yet i have the ROM on my USB

2014-11-25 14:05:21	DragonRift	Win32/64, Linux 32/64 are confirmed so far, MacOSX, Android are planned
2014-11-25 14:05:30	eleuin	k, thats good enough for me then
2014-11-25 14:05:42	eleuin	you sir deserve a cookie for supporting linux
2014-11-25 14:05:54	DragonRift	Native Linux
2014-11-25 14:06:14	DragonRift	but the webplayer (free version) is still using unity webplayer
2014-11-25 14:06:38	DragonRift	downloadable version unlock will be 9.95
2014-11-25 14:07:08	eleuin	i could support android for my game if i decided to port it over to android, but i mean, with a simple export, i could easily support the 3 major desktop platforms and a web version using JS

2014-11-25 14:31:56	sarseo	yah.
2014-11-25 14:32:06	Eleuin	sweet, you know its debian based, right?
2014-11-25 14:32:08	sarseo	i dun really want to build a custom PC to do it.
2014-11-25 14:32:15	sarseo	yah, i heard about that.
2014-11-25 14:32:31	Eleuin	debian is well known for being rock solid stable
2014-11-25 14:33:15	sarseo	well, the way i see it, i shouldn't really need any further computer upgrades after it comes out (maybe 1 more).  because i can just stream any classics from my PC to my console.
2014-11-25 14:34:05	Eleuin	i honestly will probably set up a media server sometime, to store all my music and stuff

2014-11-25 15:54:17	sarseo	King_DuckZ, i've used cocos2d-x a bit, it's okay.  simple enough to use.  it does use Tiled map editor for maps if you need it.  it also comes with Box2D libs.
2014-11-25 15:54:44	sarseo	the newest version is a little nicer and had rendering improvements.
2014-11-25 15:56:01	King_DuckZ	sarseo: thanks, yes I'm trying v3
2014-11-25 15:56:21	sarseo	thing is, their documentation is really shitty... you also won't get much help from the irc channel or forums.  you'll have to occasionally resort to looking at the engine's source.
2014-11-25 15:57:27	King_DuckZ	hm I'm already guessing as much, by the fact I don't see an includes/ directory in the lib's root dir and the instructions on the wiki are like uhm yeah type ./setup.py er... source .bash_profile or w/e
2014-11-25 15:57:41	sarseo	the setup will take a bit
2014-11-25 15:57:43	sarseo	it's the first test
2014-11-25 15:57:51	sarseo	mine broke the first time
2014-11-25 15:57:54	sarseo	and the second time.
2014-11-25 15:57:58	King_DuckZ	do you mean I'm obliged to run the test?

2014-11-25 15:58:07	King_DuckZ	newguise1234: :D
2014-11-25 15:58:16	sarseo	i'll try. XD
2014-11-25 15:58:21	sarseo	i don't know everything about cocos2dx
2014-11-25 16:00:14	King_DuckZ	hm I'm asking because my project also uses cmake, so the best for me would be to have my master cmake to pull in cocos2dx and just treat is as a normal library
2014-11-25 16:00:31	King_DuckZ	having to run python scripts will just make the build process more painful
2014-11-25 16:00:54	sarseo	as far as i know, the python scripts are only used for creating projects
2014-11-25 16:01:00	sarseo	they're meant to simplify your life a little.
2014-11-25 16:01:13	sarseo	the setup.py is probably for loading all the dependencies n s***.
2014-11-25 16:02:32	sarseo	my projects are all under <cocos2d-path>/projects/

2014-11-25 20:04:20	paultech	There was game engines in 1994 and 2004 :p
2014-11-25 20:04:35	paultech	I agree most projects don't need their own engine but you shouldn't discourage people from doing it
2014-11-25 20:04:41	Gulaangga	paultech: technology difficulty increased a lot
2014-11-25 20:04:57	paultech	Sure, but your making a game, its rather tech in nature ;)
2014-11-25 20:05:04	Gulaangga	you should do an engine or work with unpopular one in one case: you're going to be an engine developer
2014-11-25 20:05:07	Gulaangga	and need practice
2014-11-25 20:05:19	paultech	Not sure I agree with you but I do get where your coming from
2014-11-25 20:05:21	Gulaangga	if you want game - then make game
2014-11-25 20:05:43	paultech	I do, but it does involve making a engine in my case cause I'm more comfortable in my own engine and its not a huge setback

2014-11-25 20:06:29	DragonRift	hi paultech
2014-11-25 20:06:49	paultech	No, you didn't say Hi to me earlier you can't make up for it now
2014-11-25 20:06:55	DragonRift	paultech: I know I said hi 5-6 hrs ago
2014-11-25 20:06:55	DragonRift	:p
2014-11-25 20:07:00	paultech	hehe
2014-11-25 20:07:12	paultech	How's it going buddy?
2014-11-25 20:07:13	Gulaangga	going to mobile platform zoo or to serious 3d should be done with good tools if you want to complete your game ;)
2014-11-25 20:07:40	paultech	man, glad I didn't need to go thru the Gulaangga approval process before I started my games!
2014-11-25 20:07:44	Gulaangga	you won't make a rocket by starting making your own pencils and paper for blueprints

2014-11-25 20:08:30	paultech	Gulaangga: my game engine even has rockets! http://i.imgur.com/HGkDNud.png
2014-11-25 20:08:31	Gulaangga	games*
2014-11-25 20:08:46	paultech	and most rockets are designed by pencil and paper! :D
2014-11-25 20:08:59	Gulaangga	yep, but engineer buys them in store
2014-11-25 20:09:20	Gulaangga	not crafting his own pencil or forging metal for a rocket :D
2014-11-25 20:09:48	paultech	well I'm not writting my own operating system for my game either, people can use windows mac or linux :)
2014-11-25 20:10:35	paultech	Just cause I don't use premade engines that are closer to modder than actual game development doesn't make me a less of a dev or less capable of shipping games (That I have numerous times)
2014-11-25 20:10:55	Gulaangga	I never said you're "less dev"
2014-11-25 20:10:57	DragonRift	paultech: I have said this before and I will say it again. Unity more then works for our needs
2014-11-25 20:11:07	Gulaangga	you're spending more hours to get things done
2014-11-25 20:11:19	Gulaangga	so, yes, you're less capable of shipping
2014-11-25 20:11:29	Gulaangga	in quantity terms
2014-11-25 20:11:32	paultech	We've had that discussion DragonRift. I agree with Unity being great for most but I don't think someone that selects to develop their own engine
2014-11-25 20:11:41	paultech	Gulaangga: Thanks for your input
2014-11-25 20:12:17	Gulaangga	Where Unity3d dev could ship 2 or 3 games, you ship one. I don't want to offend you or anything.
2014-11-25 20:12:31	Gulaangga	Just seeing many people getting their games on rails for years hurts me a bit.
2014-11-25 20:12:40	Gulaangga	Hope it's not your case.
2014-11-25 20:13:06	paultech	Oh you wont offend me, I don't mind intelligent debate. Nope, shipped a average of 2 games a year for last 12 years. I don't get caught up often! :)
2014-11-25 20:13:25	paultech	That includes when working at studios thou, not just indie
2014-11-25 20:13:35	Gulaangga	Great, then it's not your case. :)

2014-11-25 20:15:28	dutzy	using sfml, libnoise, lua and some other glue libraries i've been able to get a decent prototype up in 2 months working less than part time on it. i think my approach is somewhere in between writing almost everything from scratch vs using something like unity
2014-11-25 20:15:51	Captain_Crow	didn't someone have to make unity in the first place though? why couldn't someone else make an engine with unity quality rendering?
2014-11-25 20:16:05	dutzy	because unity already exists

2014-11-25 20:18:39	DragonRift	its not just about that but its about unified architecture

2014-11-25 20:19:13	DragonRift	?
2014-11-25 20:19:29	paultech	Define to me what "unified architecture" is to you in game development
2014-11-25 20:19:49	DragonRift	an engine architecture that does not change from product to rproduct
2014-11-25 20:20:07	paultech	Also known as a game engine
2014-11-25 20:20:36	DragonRift	my devs make an engine EVERY time they make a game
2014-11-25 20:20:42	DragonRift	many devs***
2014-11-25 20:20:51	dutzy	what
2014-11-25 20:20:53	paultech	Nothing wrong with that, you end up with a engine that only meets your features
2014-11-25 20:21:13	DragonRift	less memory footprint and cpu overheat
2014-11-25 20:21:15	paultech	Do you guys think game engine is some magic software? It can be written in 20 lines of code if all you need is to move 2d circles
2014-11-25 20:21:16	DragonRift	I understand that
2014-11-25 20:21:28	DragonRift	overhead
2014-11-25 20:21:37	Gulaangga	dutzy: you possibly could get this kind of prototype in Unity in a week
2014-11-25 20:22:16	paultech	Guess I'm more old school, I like game developers to be capable of development

2014-11-25 20:28:49	paultech	and Gulaangga - What's the fear of D? Just cause not that many developers for it?
2014-11-25 20:29:03	paultech	Cause speed wise? D is just as good as C/C++?
2014-11-25 20:29:10	Gulaangga	paultech: no developer, no libraries, no anything
2014-11-25 20:29:24	Gulaangga	I don't care about speed THAT much in 2014 :D
2014-11-25 20:29:30	paultech	lol
2014-11-25 20:30:12	Gulaangga	we have server in node.js and it works fast during highload tests

2014-11-25 20:31:10	paultech	Gotcha, best of luck with it!
2014-11-25 20:32:29	Captain_Crow	so if i wanted to make a high quality game engine and not just a game, would it be easier finding information to work with opengl directly or is there some other rendering tool/library/engine that would make it easier to work with opengl?
2014-11-25 20:32:55	Gulaangga	paultech: Thank you. Ok, time to sleep.
2014-11-25 20:33:00	paultech	Enjoy!
2014-11-25 20:33:27	paultech	Captain_Crow: I would go with a rendering library to handle the rendering unless you are comfortable with it

2014-11-25 22:14:56	Captain_Crow	do they work with the weight paint thing or is that something exclusive to blender?
2014-11-25 22:16:17	Captain_Crow	the reason for weight paint is because joints like elbows aren't always a sharp turn, so the "weight" can be split between 2 bones
2014-11-25 22:17:45	newguise1234	https://github.com/horde3d/Horde3D
2014-11-25 22:18:03	newguise1234	I'm assuming thats what they mean by "Skeletal animation with up to 4 weights per vertex for articulated models"
2014-11-25 22:18:17	newguise1234	but I'm not sure, sorry about that
2014-11-25 22:19:22	Captain_Crow	im not sure what the 4 weights mean
2014-11-25 22:19:44	newguise1234	I think it means you can weight a vertices movemnt by up to 4 weights
2014-11-25 22:20:10	newguise1234	so you can chose up to 4 movements, and weight your vertex's movement on those
2014-11-25 22:20:17	Captain_Crow	i think blender stacks the weights for each bone
2014-11-25 22:21:22	Captain_Crow	i mean it doesnt affect the bone, but if it says 4 weights per bone it might count each bone as a weight
2014-11-25 22:21:52	newguise1234	k, I'm using the term weight as a single scalar, as in a weighted average
2014-11-25 22:22:08	newguise1234	so you can have your vertices position based upon the rotation of up to 4 bones
2014-11-25 22:22:48	newguise1234	http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/manual_18.html
2014-11-25 22:23:22	newguise1234	it looks like you can implement your own skeletal animation with weighted vertices in ogre, but I don't think it comes out of the box

2014-11-25 22:24:40	Captain_Crow	i've tried bge, it isn't going to work for what i want to do
2014-11-25 22:24:45	newguise1234	but that should give you the ability to utilize any feature you're already using in blender

2014-11-25 22:32:44	newguise1234	ogre is mit license, so no issue there, and horde3d is EPL, so you would just have to contribute any improvements or changes you make to the engine
2014-11-25 22:33:48	newguise1234	Also, my apologies for only talking about ogre and horde3d, it would be more difficult for me to look through more engines at the same time

2014-11-25 22:34:55	newguise1234	Not having used it, but just based on how many times I've read its small and lightweight, I'm leaning towards horde3d

2014-11-26 00:05:11	Captain_Crow	is it easier to work with mesh animations instead of bone?
2014-11-26 00:05:42	newguise1234	bones will allow a more diverse amount of movement, rather than static sets of animations you specifically code
2014-11-26 00:06:11	newguise1234	but if your games doesn't actually require a skeleton, you could use bones solely in blender
2014-11-26 00:06:18	newguise1234	and export different steps in the mesh animation
2014-11-26 00:07:31	newguise1234	you could also try using the collada format if you can't find a plugin for the blitz3d exporting
2014-11-26 00:07:50	newguise1234	irrlicht seems to have pretty good support for that and I think blender does as well
2014-11-26 00:08:01	newguise1234	the most recent post I can find about it is from a couple years ago though

2014-11-26 01:22:09	waressearcher2	was dukenukem a 3D like quake or it was 2.5D like doom ?
2014-11-26 01:30:22	sww	2.5D
2014-11-26 01:32:00	sww	Very similar renderer to Doom.
2014-11-26 01:33:05	waressearcher2	so 2.5D means that levels can't have second floor right above 1st floor ?
2014-11-26 01:33:20	waressearcher2	also the same 2.5D type of engine is in blood ?
2014-11-26 01:33:39	sww	"2.5D" is kind of a nebulous term. It doesn't define a particular renderer or set of restrictions.
2014-11-26 01:34:30	sww	Something like Road Rash could also be said to be 2.5D, despite being very different from Duke3D/Doom/friends.
2014-11-26 01:35:00	sww	It's more like "an essentially 2D game that uses graphics trickery to look like 6-DoF 3D".
2014-11-26 01:35:24	waressearcher2	also sprites in doom are like following you, when you trying go around a tree it always turns to you, is that a limitation of engine you can't have static sprites or it was made to make it more visually appealing ?
2014-11-26 01:35:26	sww	(Where 6-DoF is 6 degrees of freedom motion, a.k.a "full 3D", like Quake that you mentioned.)
2014-11-26 01:35:52	sww	A limitation. 3D models were too expensive to render.
2014-11-26 01:36:10	sww	...Mostly. Later games like Daggerfall featured simple low-poly models in conjunction with billboard sprites.
2014-11-26 01:36:18	waressearcher2	no, I don't ask "why they use sprites" I ask why sprites following you ? they always turn to you 
2014-11-26 01:36:33	sww	Because they're flat -- there's no "other side" to see.
2014-11-26 01:36:49	sww	They made a picture of one side of a tree.

2014-11-26 01:37:27	sww	Right. Technically, it's easier to make them 'follow you' then make them look flat at acute angles.

2014-11-26 01:41:29	the8thark	Old ass TV show called happy days on TV. On ot one of the characters jumped a shark on a surfboard.  It?s well known thew show went to crap at that exact moment.  And it never recovered.  SO now when a TV show ?jumps the shark? it means that tv show went bad and never recovered to being good again.  It can be related to many things jumping the shark.  And that part of my leave message is a reference to that in a funny way.

2014-11-26 04:48:58	Brain	Sendoushi: well, it depends
2014-11-26 04:49:05	Brain	Sendoushi: i was writing my game in C# using the XNA framework
2014-11-26 04:49:12	Brain	then i took a 3 year haitus
2014-11-26 04:49:39	Brain	now when i come back i find that microsoft have shitcanned the API and are recommending monogame, which isnt even /supported/ officially by an indie games store any more on xbox one.
2014-11-26 04:49:48	Brain	so, im now rewriting my game in straight C++ with directx 11
2014-11-26 04:49:52	Sendoushi	i see
2014-11-26 04:49:55	Sendoushi	2d or 3d?
2014-11-26 04:49:58	Brain	3d
2014-11-26 04:50:00	Brain	the old one was 2d
2014-11-26 04:50:20	Brain	i took it as an opportunity to learn new things that i havent really dabbled much in
2014-11-26 04:50:29	Sendoushi	i see
2014-11-26 04:51:08	Sendoushi	i'm trying to decide. i've been a web developer for a long time now 
2014-11-26 04:52:20	Brain	and youre looking to get into gamedev?
2014-11-26 04:52:26	Brain	which platform?
2014-11-26 04:53:31	Sendoushi	mobile / desktop
2014-11-26 04:53:40	Sendoushi	not really into 3d games
2014-11-26 04:53:49	Brain	ah
2014-11-26 04:53:51	Sendoushi	maybe some isometrics but still 2d
2014-11-26 04:53:52	Brain	windows? linux?
2014-11-26 04:53:58	Sendoushi	both
2014-11-26 04:54:02	Brain	hmm
2014-11-26 04:54:17	Brain	if you want portability across all of those it might be worth learning monogame, how's your C#?
2014-11-26 04:54:38	Brain	failing that you can look at pygame, but im no sure of its ability to support mobile platforms
2014-11-26 04:54:59	Sendoushi	looked at pygame but from what i've seen... not really that portable
2014-11-26 04:55:15	Sendoushi	my c# isn't ehehe never developed in that code
2014-11-26 04:55:18	Brain	monogame is a C# framework, the replacement for XNA
2014-11-26 04:55:32	Brain	but if you've never used C# before you might find the learning curve a bit steep
2014-11-26 04:56:00	Brain	you might make better progress picking something simple to start off
2014-11-26 04:56:01	Sendoushi	what about html strategies?
2014-11-26 04:56:09	Brain	a simple test concept on one platform in a language youre comfortable with
2014-11-26 04:56:15	Brain	web games?
2014-11-26 04:56:28	Sendoushi	since i'm already savvy in web techs
2014-11-26 04:56:39	Sendoushi	web games still are portable
2014-11-26 04:56:42	Brain	well imho web games are still games, and theres still fun in it, and a market for it
2014-11-26 04:56:49	Sendoushi	i think there are even ways to wrap it to something like a "native" app
2014-11-26 04:56:56	Brain	however, the concepts in web games are very different to those in desktop/mobile games
2014-11-26 04:57:02	Sendoushi	why so?
2014-11-26 04:57:08	Brain	generally desktop/mobile games arent event driven in the same way as javascript
2014-11-26 04:57:08	Sendoushi	sorry the inocent questions
2014-11-26 04:57:13	Sendoushi	something like a devil advocate
2014-11-26 04:57:24	Brain	if you were to write a game for a desktop pc, it is basically one infinite blocking loop
2014-11-26 04:57:26	Brain	like this:
2014-11-26 04:57:34	Sendoushi	yes. like in actionscript
2014-11-26 04:57:53	Brain	while (true) { read_inputs(); update_game(); draw_to_screen(); }
2014-11-26 04:58:17	Brain	whereas in js you might have three functions attached to events in the browser
2014-11-26 04:58:21	Sendoushi	what i find worse from javascript / html approach is canvas cleaning and not really class based but i guess that is the base of game development
2014-11-26 04:58:32	Brain	yeah

2014-11-26 04:58:48	Sendoushi	there are always libs like pixi.js and phaser
2014-11-26 04:58:53	Brain	in directx 11 for example you have a set of buffers each of which represents the screen
2014-11-26 04:58:57	Brain	you write to one, while displaying the other
2014-11-26 04:59:02	Brain	and when youre done writing, you flip them
2014-11-26 04:59:04	Sendoushi	i think there is even a port for processing now in js

2014-11-26 04:59:12	Brain	that way you don't get 'tearing' artifacts etc
2014-11-26 04:59:22	Sendoushi	that's more less the strategy for game dev in html and py
2014-11-26 04:59:26	Brain	ive never looked at html canvas, but im guessing thats the same
2014-11-26 04:59:33	Sendoushi	yes it is
2014-11-26 04:59:44	Sendoushi	you don't flip it though. you just "clean it"
2014-11-26 05:00:19	Brain	also you don't really write to the display directly, even though you kind of have the ability to, you write mini-programs called shaders that are executed by the gpu, and those transform and translate your graphics calls
2014-11-26 05:00:27	Brain	e.g. texture mapping, lighting etc are all done in shader functions
2014-11-26 05:00:37	Sendoushi	these questions come because i need to evolve a little outside of the company i'm at. do my own thing i guess
2014-11-26 05:00:52	Sendoushi	i see...
2014-11-26 05:00:56	Brain	well its definitely a fun field to get into
2014-11-26 05:01:13	Sendoushi	doesnt seem so loool
2014-11-26 05:01:13	Brain	i decided long ago i'd like to keep gamedev a hobby, rather than a paid job
2014-11-26 05:01:50	Sendoushi	i don't really want gamedev as a full time job also
2014-11-26 05:01:54	Brain	working in games officially is probably one of the most unstable lines of work right now, studios are coming and going, publishers are driving down development costs
2014-11-26 05:01:58	Sendoushi	too much stressful
2014-11-26 05:02:04	Brain	and the deadlines.... yeah

2014-11-26 05:02:25	Brain	but these days? its just another programming job
2014-11-26 05:02:47	Sendoushi	as a full time job i'll stick with design and front end development
2014-11-26 05:02:48	Brain	i get paid the same amount now as an IT manager and industrial software dev as i would be paid at a well known game company i bet
2014-11-26 05:03:03	Sendoushi	i would like to have some extra works though
2014-11-26 05:03:06	Brain	and i get to work from home when i want, the stress is less
2014-11-26 05:03:11	Sendoushi	like app dev and web dev and such
2014-11-26 05:03:30	Brain	Sendoushi: i used to do web dev
2014-11-26 05:03:37	Sendoushi	yes the same decision i took when i decided to work less as a designer and more as a dev
2014-11-26 05:03:46	Brain	now i kind of do a weird bastardization of webdev
2014-11-26 05:03:53	Sendoushi	eheh
2014-11-26 05:04:11	Brain	basically i maintain an in-house system that runs an industrial business, its written 90% in php and 10% in c#
2014-11-26 05:04:34	Brain	so its web dev, but not websites, it has to integrate with all kinds of rammel
2014-11-26 05:04:52	Brain	its like half web dev, half systems dev
2014-11-26 05:04:55	Sendoushi	yes i see
2014-11-26 05:05:07	Sendoushi	everyday that passes i'm more of a js developer
2014-11-26 05:05:10	Sendoushi	i kind of like it
2014-11-26 05:05:27	Sendoushi	now i look at my website and i just say "php, pfffff"

2014-11-26 05:10:13	Sendoushi	King_DuckZ: tried already that and seemed interesting
2014-11-26 05:10:14	King_DuckZ	sdl2 is another good choice imo if you want less of an engine
2014-11-26 05:10:32	Sendoushi	though developing c++ takes like the double of time of developing in web techs
2014-11-26 05:10:52	King_DuckZ	or unigine is probably also good if you have the money, though I don't think it will ever work on arm, so you're cutting possibilities there

2014-11-26 05:49:48	sebbu	well, there's also a part due to the workflow which often use several different tools, some of them possibly with *very* *long* generation times
2014-11-26 05:50:31	sebbu	want to test the engine, you need audio, 3d models, textures, ui elements, etc...
2014-11-26 05:50:41	Sendoushi	true
2014-11-26 05:50:56	sebbu	King_DuckZ, D ? :D
2014-11-26 05:51:04	Sendoushi	but when you see web dev you see that no one tries to do everything. the ones who do are less and less used
2014-11-26 05:51:22	Sendoushi	you have modules where one treats the audio, the other treats the ui...
2014-11-26 05:51:35	sebbu	i'm not saying one does everything
2014-11-26 05:51:42	sebbu	but to test the engine, you need all assets
2014-11-26 05:51:43	Sendoushi	which makes it a better approach regarding what you said

2014-11-26 09:53:36	stoopdapoop	I don't know if there's any survey for this, but I figure it'll look similar to the list of languages that are the most popular in general

2014-11-26 11:02:48	sarseo	hello folks
2014-11-26 11:03:47	sarseo	phao, i'd agree with paultech... C++ seems to be the most common for game dev, though indies have been using a lot of managed alternatives.  as i understand it tho, even they have to delve into unmanaged code for some things.
2014-11-26 11:03:47	<--	raunicolae (~raunicola@84.117.177.127) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2014-11-26 11:05:35	sarseo	main reason is performance, obviously.  but that's highly debated nowadays.  technology is so fast that managed code is "quicker and good enough".  other arguments against is that some languages such as python can "out-perform" C++, though these are based on test cases, not any demonstrated titles i'm aware of.
2014-11-26 11:05:53	Brend	They're based on optimistic bullshit, mostly
2014-11-26 11:06:17	sarseo	i wouldn't know.  just relaying based on past conversations. :3
2014-11-26 11:06:25	Brend	Modern C++ is a pretty high-level language anyway
2014-11-26 11:06:34	Brend	Although I remain kind of surprised it has no serious competitors
2014-11-26 11:07:20	sarseo	personally, i think the python > C++ performance argument is based on impractical scenarios.
2014-11-26 11:07:47	sarseo	it's easy to write a test for two languages and say: "this one runs better", because... it's a test, not a full-blown game.
2014-11-26 11:09:23	King_DuckZ	Brend: I think D *is* a competitor, it's even implied in the name
2014-11-26 11:09:34	Brend	King_DuckZ: It's not a serious competitor
2014-11-26 11:09:41	Brend	Perhaps it could have been, but its compiler was too broken for too long
2014-11-26 11:09:51	Brend	I hear it's gotten better recently but it's probably too late.
2014-11-26 11:10:16	King_DuckZ	Brend: I've only picked it up recently, but had a good impression - only the arm build was broken for a long time in my exp
2014-11-26 11:10:34	Brend	Yeah it has a reputation for being a good language -- but the tools really were broken
2014-11-26 11:10:41	King_DuckZ	Brend: iono, I see there are at least 3 to choose from, I'd say at least one works?
2014-11-26 11:10:43	Brend	And now Rust has all the hype and D probably won't get a second chance.

2014-11-26 11:11:59	sarseo	thought you were giving cocos2d-x a go?
2014-11-26 11:12:18	sarseo	btw, King_DuckZ, you can also just code in javascript or lua for cocos2d-x
2014-11-26 11:12:41	Brend	(I'm pretty happy with Go lately, and think it could be a pretty decent language for games, but it's not a competitor for C++ either, at least performance wise)
2014-11-26 11:12:44	King_DuckZ	I had this project where I coded something in D (I'm a noob) in a couple hours, but then the compiler for arm was broken and I had some serious problem with cmake+d (I think it's fixed now), so the result is I re-wrote it in c++ (I'm pretty good at it) and it took me a day or so to rewrite everything -_-
2014-11-26 11:13:13	King_DuckZ	sarseo: I'm planning to use it from d, if I fail I'll just use c++

2014-11-26 13:11:39	hexhaxtron	Hi! A long time ago I was using some app to change the values of lives or ammo in the game. I think it was called 'monitor'. I would put 5 there, lose one life, put 4 there, lose another life, put 3 there and then it would discover the place in memory of the lives allowing me to change it to 99.
2014-11-26 13:11:48	hexhaxtron	Is there something like that for Linux?
2014-11-26 13:12:09	hexhaxtron	For 'a long time ago' I mean the MS-DOS era.

2014-11-27 13:57:57	paultech	Game assets or just the game binary needs updated ?
2014-11-27 13:58:07	paultech	If so, can you have a simple version number and a zip file for assets and binary?

2014-11-27 13:58:54	paultech	on the other end of the spectrum you can do checksum checks on file and compare against a src server and maintain delta changes to preform patching

2014-11-27 15:41:47	sarseo	there's also this site which sometimes helps, but a lot of it is outdated info: http://www.raywenderlich.com/
2014-11-27 15:41:55	King_DuckZ	well it will have to suffice then :)
2014-11-27 15:42:43	King_DuckZ	I found one called wizardfu, I'm still not sure it's a good resource... it's trying to teach c++ basics, then I think the browser on my mobile crashed or something
2014-11-27 15:42:53	King_DuckZ	ah maybe I had to get off the train
2014-11-27 15:43:02	sarseo	it's pretty straightforward.  your AppDelegate is the entry point.  your "Scene" is the level or stage you want to present on screen which is comprised of "Layers"
2014-11-27 15:43:22	King_DuckZ	right, makes sense
2014-11-27 15:43:46	sarseo	You will probably want to inherit the cocos2d-x classes to make them do more.  at least, that's what i do.
2014-11-27 15:43:58	King_DuckZ	so is there some graph-like class to enable the user going from one scene to the other? (I'm assuming the main menu is a scene and so on)
2014-11-27 15:46:09	sarseo	i haven't gotten that far, but the Director object handles all that.  it's in a singleton.

2014-11-27 21:37:12	Jumblemuddle	Does anyone have a nice example of using delta time in a multiplayer (server <-> client) game? I know I need to use it somehow, and I want the server to be completely authoritative. (e.g. the server receives keys pressed and moves players then responds with new position) However, I'm not sure how to make the server have a fixed update rate (20 ticks per second?).
2014-11-27 21:40:24	Jumblemuddle	I'm beginning to think that I should have a fixed update rate on my clients and only use delta time to render the 'prediction' between each update. That way the client would send updates to the server at the same rate that the server is running (20 ticks per second). Would I need to make the server reject packets if they are sent faster than the 20 ticks per second?
2014-11-27 21:41:01	Jumblemuddle	Also, are there any good examples of a (preferably libgdx) game that has a fixed update rate while allowing for (theoretically) infinite draw frame rate?

2014-11-28 16:20:05	Silent	Hello :)
2014-11-28 16:20:33	Silent	Guys, I need help. I'm having a hard time understanding player interation in turn-based coop games
2014-11-28 16:21:00	Silent	I need to figure out exactly what makes a turn-based game good at cooperation
2014-11-28 16:21:20	Silent	Ex, 2v2 chess is a bad idea, but other games such as spades do it very well.
2014-11-28 16:22:25	-->	mtsr (~mtsr@5468CA14.cm-12-1d.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has joined #gamedev
2014-11-28 16:23:42	Cahaan	interesting question Silent 
2014-11-28 16:24:35	<--	mtsr (~mtsr@5468CA14.cm-12-1d.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has quit (Client Quit)
2014-11-28 16:25:01	Silent	Cahaan, Thank you. I believe the key is that spades has hidden cards, so communication between teammates is key. This is not the case in chess, where all pieces are revealed
2014-11-28 16:25:42	Cahaan	a lot of different mechanisms can make coop games fun
2014-11-28 16:25:47	Silent	However, I do not know many cooperative turn-based games to study. I would be very glad to hear any suggestions
2014-11-28 16:26:05	Cahaan	you could take some inspiration from boardgames
2014-11-28 16:26:25	Silent	Do you have any specific examples in mind?
2014-11-28 16:26:34	Cahaan	my favourite one is when you play against the game (or against an IA), but you may have a traitor among the other players
2014-11-28 16:26:40	Cahaan	and that traitor is playing against the group
2014-11-28 16:26:43	Cahaan	but secretly
2014-11-28 16:27:17	Cahaan	example of such boardgame: Dead of Winter (from Plaid Hat Games)
2014-11-28 16:27:33	Silent	That sounds very interesting
2014-11-28 16:27:59	Cahaan	players are trying to survive zombie apocalypse but have their own secret objectives. The secret objectives might go against the group interests

2014-11-28 16:29:35	Silent	I see
2014-11-28 16:31:08	Cahaan	I think spades is not really a cooperative game
2014-11-28 16:31:21	Cahaan	is more a team based game
2014-11-28 16:31:42	Cahaan	but the main gameplay is about competition

2014-11-28 16:33:32	Silent	When I said cooperative, I mean that players work in teams. Either agains another team, or agiansh the game like you said
2014-11-28 16:33:52	Silent	againt*
2014-11-28 16:34:42	Cahaan	yes the definition is a bit stricter in the boardgames world

2014-11-28 16:45:26	Silent	Classic mechanics such as rogue don't translate very well if all you do is toss in another player
2014-11-28 16:45:41	Silent	They have ro interact somehow, and support each other

2014-11-28 22:09:14	mr_yogurt	I'm trying to figure out how to draw a bent arm without losing the blocky feel he has now. Although the mouth ruined that a little bit.
2014-11-28 22:09:17	newguise1234	so, I've done nothing with scene trees, but I've read about sorting by occulsion, z-value and the such axion
2014-11-28 22:10:07	newguise1234	mr_yogurt: I'm not really an artist, but you could do a pi/2 bend at the elbow
2014-11-28 22:10:14	newguise1234	then a pi/2 rotation at the shoulder

2014-11-28 22:11:26	mr_yogurt	I'll try watching some videos of people throwing frisbees to get a feel for it
2014-11-28 22:11:53	newguise1234	I think if you keep it to 90-degrees you will keep the blocky feel, but I'm not sure
2014-11-28 22:12:03	newguise1234	(90-degree movements)
2014-11-28 22:12:15	mr_yogurt	I think the thing that would kill it the most is shading
2014-11-28 22:12:26	mr_yogurt	Or, more shading than is there already to distinguish parts of his body
2014-11-28 22:12:42	newguise1234	I think you could pull it off

2014-11-28 22:15:06	newguise1234	cool

2014-11-28 22:16:16	newguise1234	no problem, I just had to write a wrapper class for vectors(c++ arrays) so I could sort an index list and leave the underlying set of vectors alone
2014-11-28 22:16:20	newguise1234	I thought it was somewhat similar
2014-11-28 22:16:58	newguise1234	axion: have you sorted anything in lisp yet?
2014-11-28 22:17:50	axion	yes, before i had a scene tree
2014-11-28 22:18:15	newguise1234	oh, so the sorting is to take place within the tree structure?
2014-11-28 22:18:20	newguise1234	sorry for being dense man
2014-11-28 22:19:51	newguise1234	axion: my limited experience with spacial data structures is that its easier to create a sorted one from the beginning
2014-11-28 22:19:53	axion	yeah. considering my camera will never rotate, i need a way to just draw leaves of the tree based on their y position relative to the camera, while still allowing the scene tree to know about their parents/children. basically i have a local basis and a world basis. i use this so entities can move relative to their parent (think: moon reolving around the earth, earth revolving around the sun)...so an entity
2014-11-28 22:19:55	axion	does not need to know about the world basis
2014-11-28 22:20:33	newguise1234	not necessarily the most efficient way, but
2014-11-28 22:20:39	newguise1234	you could create a render array from the tree nodes
2014-11-28 22:20:45	newguise1234	and sort that based on the y values
2014-11-28 22:21:12	newguise1234	preferably pointing at the data in the tree/wherever rather than copying it
2014-11-28 22:21:27	newguise1234	then just render the array
2014-11-28 22:21:45	axion	hmm ok i'll look into that
2014-11-28 22:23:30	newguise1234	axion: I only read through the "Enter: Data-Oriented Design" section, but I thought it was kind of interesting. http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/what-is-data-oriented-game-engine-design--cms-21052

2014-11-28 22:44:37	axion	ok
2014-11-28 22:44:43	newguise1234	if it is like the solar system, and children nodes will always be order(s) of magnitude closer to their parents than the parent's siblings
2014-11-28 22:44:57	newguise1234	you can do y ordering solely on sibling levels
2014-11-28 22:45:19	newguise1234	you could do that in-tree as well
2014-11-28 22:45:26	axion	hmmm
2014-11-28 22:45:42	newguise1234	ie. left most child has the highest/lowest y-value
2014-11-28 22:46:09	newguise1234	that sorting would break down if one node's child does at one point become closer to another node
2014-11-28 22:46:25	newguise1234	*than one of the other node's children*

2014-11-29 17:02:32	knod	I'm trying to find any articles about it, but I haven't had much luck
2014-11-29 17:02:47	newguise1234	in my mind I'm referencing pictures on the wall from mario 64
2014-11-29 17:02:54	newguise1234	and the pictures in braid
2014-11-29 17:02:58	newguise1234	both are used as portals
2014-11-29 17:04:01	knod	I actually found the mario one jarring personally. Haven't played braid
2014-11-29 17:04:13	knod	It just broke immersion for me
2014-11-29 17:04:21	newguise1234	the other series of images/etc I'm thinking of are the graphics in riven/myst
2014-11-29 17:04:32	newguise1234	I found those to be on the "realistic" side
2014-11-29 17:04:58	newguise1234	and it would be an example of a world with many things to interact with where the environment was cohesive
2014-11-29 17:04:58	knod	That's true, that was done pretty well actually. Still a bit jarring, but they were sort of cordoned off

2014-11-29 17:06:51	newguise1234	if you had different physics implementations or some differences in the type of gameplay, you could use stylization associated with that
2014-11-29 17:07:04	newguise1234	I realize you don't necessarily even want to use pictures as portals or some such
2014-11-29 17:08:03	knod	I'm writing a paper and the thought came up. I don't know if I'll even mention it in the paper since it's a bit off-topic, but I found the debate interesting (in my head at least)
2014-11-29 17:08:04	newguise1234	if you give me more constraints on the setting I could think about it closer to the lines you are
2014-11-29 17:08:12	newguise1234	cool
2014-11-29 17:08:17	knod	Like I said, I wanted to find articles on it, but I couldn't :/
2014-11-29 17:08:33	knod	I was thinking of a situation where people could put their own images into a game,
2014-11-29 17:08:48	knod	but I'd think the images would then have to be stylized so that they wouldn't distract from the rest of the game
2014-11-29 17:08:55	newguise1234	I think it comes down to, anything that breaks the cohesion, should be doing so for a reason
2014-11-29 17:09:06	newguise1234	unless the entire game is about breaking cohesion at every turn lol
2014-11-29 17:09:31	newguise1234	<-- is very much an amatuer though
2014-11-29 17:10:19	knod	I agree, but I'm a n00b too :)
2014-11-29 17:10:59	newguise1234	if you can pull off a transition from stylized to realistic that might work?
2014-11-29 17:11:07	newguise1234	there are so many ways to stylize things as well though
2014-11-29 17:11:17	newguise1234	whats your paper on in general?

2014-11-29 17:13:48	newguise1234	on the note of an uncoherent environment, I came across this a year or so ago. http://science.slashdot.org/story/11/11/04/2027250/mathematically-pattern-free-music
2014-11-29 17:14:08	knod	And I'm writing about instructional design in a game

2014-11-29 17:21:09	newguise1234	haha thanks
2014-11-29 17:21:54	knod	It sounds like the beginnings of tense parts in some horror movies I think, though I can't name one
2014-11-29 17:24:11	newguise1234	I came across it after reading in a book about using negative space in art, ie. the chair isn't defined by whats there, but by where the wood stops.
2014-11-29 17:24:21	newguise1234	*a part in a book*
2014-11-29 17:24:52	knod	Heh
2014-11-29 17:24:54	knod	Yeah
2014-11-29 17:24:59	newguise1234	so I guess I was somewhat thinking about those when thinking of the coherency of game design
2014-11-29 17:25:13	newguise1234	and if you can construct patterns through reducing the coherency of patterns you're using
2014-11-29 17:25:18	newguise1234	if that makes much sense

2014-11-29 17:26:10	newguise1234	and I was then trying to draw the realistic pictures to tie in with that, but I don't have any further idea as to how to continue the train of thought

2014-11-30 00:24:41	newguise1234	Mallot1: did affixing the query work?
2014-11-30 00:25:11	Mallot1	newguise1234: Sorry I don't know what you mean by affixing the query
2014-11-30 00:25:22	newguise1234	put ?dl=1 at the end of your link
2014-11-30 00:25:29	newguise1234	https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/201
2014-11-30 00:25:42	newguise1234	forces a file or folder to download
2014-11-30 00:25:56	newguise1234	instead of accessing a rendered preview
2014-11-30 00:26:54	newguise1234	or, if dropbox relies on file extensions you could name it version.zip, and then just treat it as a txt after you download it
2014-11-30 00:27:20	newguise1234	thats what you were able to do with gmail to get around their ban of emailing zips/exe
2014-11-30 00:27:26	Mallot1	the ?dl=1 didn't work
2014-11-30 00:27:41	Mallot1	I'll try the .zip
2014-11-30 00:27:54	newguise1234	make sure you grab the new link after changing the name
2014-11-30 00:28:08	newguise1234	I don't know what will change, but I'm pretty sure the old link won't work anymore
2014-11-30 00:29:20	Mallot1	that was a very smart idea but I have no idea why that didn't work
2014-11-30 00:29:48	newguise1234	would you mind sending the link? maybe I can try?
2014-11-30 00:29:54	Mallot1	sure

2014-11-30 01:44:34	fleshtheworld	the new animation system in unity is the key reason why i stop working with unity. i just didnt like it, you cant event access many of its feature to do whatever - the code is hidden / locked. so i decided to just focus on working on my own engine instead.

2014-11-30 01:48:19	fleshtheworld	yeap, making a 3d graphics engine has always been a desire of mine, the game is just a side thing.

2014-11-30 02:33:26	waressearcher2	what limits the size of a level in game ? for example you can't make entire city as GTA5 using doom 3 engine, why ? or it doesn't need to be an open world it could be a huge underground facility, but if you remember levels in doom 3 not so huge, it was impossible to make one huge level using doom3 engine ?
2014-11-30 02:35:06	siavashserver	I guess the amount of memory and how versatile your occlusion culler is
2014-11-30 02:35:34	newguise1234	it depends on how you are storing data as well
2014-11-30 02:35:38	waressearcher2	what is "occlusion culler" ?
2014-11-30 02:35:52	newguise1234	for example: cube2 stores everything in an octree I believe
2014-11-30 02:36:10	waressearcher2	so does that mean when people create open world game like farcry3 or GTA5 they specifically optimize engine to open world level ?
2014-11-30 02:36:28	siavashserver	waressearcher2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_surface_determination
2014-11-30 02:36:47	newguise1234	I would believe so
2014-11-30 02:38:00	newguise1234	I don't remember what engine, but there was one game in which they specifically designed the levels so there would not be certain lightmap overlays
2014-11-30 02:38:07	waressearcher2	so why not to make all engines to support open worlds by default ?
2014-11-30 02:38:15	waressearcher2	that way there will not be limits
2014-11-30 02:38:15	newguise1234	this allowed them to implement a ver versatile lighting renderer
2014-11-30 02:38:19	newguise1234	*very
2014-11-30 02:38:28	newguise1234	gave a lot of cool dynamic effects
2014-11-30 02:38:38	newguise1234	they were just constrained by the level designs
2014-11-30 02:38:48	newguise1234	so one area would not improperly affect an adjacent

2014-11-30 03:04:04	newguise1234	but if you want to hold more than 4GB of data in your memory, you need a greater than 32-bit architecture
2014-11-30 03:04:51	newguise1234	or some ram access voodoo like they used in 16-bit processors to access 20-bit addresses

2014-11-30 05:41:00	iamtakingiteasy	hello
2014-11-30 05:41:02	iamtakingiteasy	i have a set of First-Point-View objects (each of them may be a camera by using it's view matrix) and i am operating in Z-up Y-depth world space (like a plane which is perpendicular to display surface, onto which you can walk), but i am not sure if my class (sort of pseudocode, but idea is working in real application) implementing transition form Y-up to Z-up is correct and efficent (maybe it's
2014-11-30 05:41:09	iamtakingiteasy	working just out of luck, maybe i don't need some performed operations): http://paste.eientei.org/show/434/ . The thing that troubles me mostly is the need to negate rotational axis' Z component in quaternion-based rotate() method. Is there a way to do that, combined with correctorYZ axis swap in just one matrix applied to a result of model transformation?

2014-11-30 13:04:30	newguise1234	iamtakingiteasy: in this case the order of rotations matters, if you want to use quaternions, I would use two quaternions, one that will rotate you vertically and one that will rotate you horizontally
2014-11-30 13:05:03	newguise1234	you can then scale each quaternion separately and apply them in the same order every time you want to get the current rotation
2014-11-30 13:06:14	newguise1234	it would be analogous to keeping pitch and yaw angles that you modify based on movement and applying them to your starting vector every time you want your current direction

2014-11-30 15:01:03	knod	What are some questions about coding that don't have to do with how to make a specific piece of code work? I mean bigger questions. Like in math there's the question of which things are truths of the world and which things are conventions that humans made up.
2014-11-30 15:04:32	newguise1234	here is a broad swath of languages grouped by descriptive properties

2014-11-30 15:05:57	newguise1234	thanks, I was only trying to come up with functional vs imperative, but I couldn't remember the word imperative
2014-11-30 15:05:58	knod	I'm actually trying to find something beginners can tackle
2014-11-30 15:06:04	knod	Sorry for not mentioning that
2014-11-30 15:06:08	newguise1234	no problem
2014-11-30 15:06:59	newguise1234	you could start with the difference between imperative(state based) and functional
2014-11-30 15:07:06	newguise1234	which in my understanding is just pure translations
2014-11-30 15:07:15	knod	Lol, even *I* don't understand what the difference is
2014-11-30 15:07:47	newguise1234	I think the difference is kind of shaky, because you can program both ways in many languages
2014-11-30 15:08:06	newguise1234	for example though f(x){return x*x;} is functional
2014-11-30 15:08:10	newguise1234	it always returns x^2
2014-11-30 15:09:04	newguise1234	f(x) { if (global_var == GRAVITY_IS_SET) return x + 9.8*dt; else return x; }
2014-11-30 15:09:20	newguise1234	would be imperative, returning position affected by gravity
2014-11-30 15:09:31	newguise1234	depending on if GRAVITY_IS_SET or not
2014-11-30 15:09:54	newguise1234	that wasn't really great code, so sorry for that, but that is my shaky understanding of it
2014-11-30 15:10:07	knod	Heh
2014-11-30 15:12:17	newguise1234	one thing I have found interesting but I'm not sure if it fits what you're looking to teach is: simd conditionals
2014-11-30 15:12:40	newguise1234	I actually try to use the concept behind them in my regular code to reduce cache-misses

2014-11-30 15:23:53	sarseo	BlueProtoman, yah, i think it's probably more game-related, but not game dev related.  that's probably why.
2014-11-30 15:24:18	newguise1234	for instance I read the part about GO TO here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#Life_and_work

2014-11-30 15:24:24	sarseo	BlueProtoman, but it sounds like it'd be useful info to game devs.
2014-11-30 15:24:48	Jumblemuddle	What is the standard practice on using delta time in multiplayer games? (With an authoritative server)
2014-11-30 15:25:11	sarseo	abuse it.
2014-11-30 15:25:24	 *	sarseo doesn't know, sorry.

2014-11-30 15:26:08	newguise1234	knod: Do they share a common interest in some programming sub-topic?

2014-11-30 15:26:33	newguise1234	you do have the concepts behind bubble sort
2014-11-30 15:26:35	newguise1234	cool
2014-11-30 15:26:52	knod	One idea is "how much can you do with an if statement"
2014-11-30 15:28:01	newguise1234	I think I am the wrong person to try to answer this haha I just keep thinking about stuff I've found interesting recently TT___TT
2014-11-30 15:28:24	newguise1234	you can talk about concurrency
2014-11-30 15:28:38	newguise1234	it is much more wide spread and easier to implement now than it was years ago
2014-11-30 15:28:54	newguise1234	and with that you can get into mutexes and semaphores
2014-11-30 15:29:41	newguise1234	that could probably follow after something related to for loops
2014-11-30 15:29:42	knod	o.O
2014-11-30 15:29:54	knod	I will note that down, but don't really know what it means
2014-11-30 15:30:00	newguise1234	due to for loops, if they dont rely on previous iterations, being pretty parallizeable
2014-11-30 15:30:03	knod	You might just be too advanced for these questions
2014-11-30 15:30:34	newguise1234	sorry man haha

2014-11-30 19:08:51	newguise1234	haha, I had just started playing with it more and it turned out it was segfaulting because I was writing to a non-writeable address
2014-11-30 19:09:23	newguise1234	I'm gonna stop talking your ear off now, just wanted to say, it is possible, you just need to use the os's methods that are in place to prevent arbitrary code execution
2014-11-30 19:09:32	newguise1234	and manipulation of what should only be readable code
2014-11-30 19:09:34	newguise1234	hey Mallot1 
2014-11-30 19:09:47	knod	Fair enought
2014-11-30 19:10:04	newguise1234	knod: or find a way to exploit a buffer overflow or something along those lines
2014-11-30 19:10:17	newguise1234	thats another topic though
2014-11-30 19:10:22	knod	Ok, new question - why is it important for a programmer to know how to access files in their programs?
2014-11-30 19:10:55	newguise1234	because it sure is tough to utilize data structures when you don't have any data to stuff in them? :p
2014-11-30 19:11:41	knod	Ok, the next question is why do you need data structures?

2014-11-30 19:12:13	knod	I mean outside of your own file
2014-11-30 19:12:29	newguise1234	because the proper data structure makes completing a task much more efficient
2014-11-30 19:13:12	knod	You mean for the human?
2014-11-30 19:13:15	newguise1234	ie. searching for a collision between N objects using a bounding volume hierarchy takes Nlog(N) operations instead of N^2
2014-11-30 19:13:51	newguise1234	searching for an item in a sorted list takes log(N) queries instead of N queries
2014-11-30 19:13:53	-->	DrAwesomeClaws (~DrAwesome@50.97.94.25-static.reverse.softlayer.com) has joined #gamedev
2014-11-30 19:14:20	knod	So bounding volume hierarchy is Nlog(N), what's the N^2 operation (out of curiosity)
2014-11-30 19:14:31	knod	Ohhh
2014-11-30 19:14:34	newguise1234	if you were to check for a collision between each object specifically
2014-11-30 19:14:34	knod	Sorted list, got it
2014-11-30 19:14:56	newguise1234	would be N-1 checks per object(to check against N-1 other objects)
2014-11-30 19:14:59	knod	Well, you do have to search for a collision with any of them
2014-11-30 19:15:22	newguise1234	and if you are checking for a collision between any two objects, you would need to do N-1 checks for N objects
2014-11-30 19:15:30	newguise1234	giving you N^2-N checks
2014-11-30 19:16:07	newguise1234	if you have 1000 objects, that means you'll be doing 1000000 checks per loop iteration
2014-11-30 19:16:10	knod	Hmm, I think the math just got to much for me
2014-11-30 19:16:32	knod	That could still all be in one file though
2014-11-30 19:16:33	newguise1234	if you use a data structure that lets you check for all collisions in Nlog(N) instead of N^2
2014-11-30 19:16:38	newguise1234	and you have 1000 objects
2014-11-30 19:16:59	newguise1234	that means 9000 checks
2014-11-30 19:17:05	newguise1234	instead of 1000000
2014-11-30 19:17:09	newguise1234	thats quite a difference
2014-11-30 19:17:45	newguise1234	you would probably have the 1000 objects stored in your file
2014-11-30 19:17:54	knod	Yeah, I do know the difference between the notations, I just can't do the math logic to understand the different checks, but it's not the question I'm asking right now
2014-11-30 19:17:56	-->	xrlk (~xrlk@216-58-27-26.cpe.distributel.net) has joined #gamedev
2014-11-30 19:18:24	knod	Right. I think the answer is because then all the data would have to be stored in one file and a human would find that hard to read
2014-11-30 19:18:28	newguise1234	alright, a more philosophical answer is, everything is a data structure :p

2014-11-30 19:18:48	knod	Well, yeah, but there's a reason to have images as separate files than a script, for example
2014-11-30 19:18:53	newguise1234	oh word
2014-11-30 19:19:11	knod	I'm not debating data structures, I'm talking about separate files
2014-11-30 19:19:20	seivan	Anyone with opinions/experience with both HaxePunk and HaxeFlixel?
2014-11-30 19:19:56	newguise1234	knod: make a reference to why you have seperate functions instead of tossing it all in one big script?
2014-11-30 19:20:04	newguise1234	seivan: what are those?
2014-11-30 19:21:16	knod	I'm actually trying to make a more engaging thing than an explanation
2014-11-30 19:21:36	knod	I mean, images would just be a bunch of binary, right?
2014-11-30 19:21:42	newguise1234	right
2014-11-30 19:21:56	newguise1234	and some image that was have png data and half jpg data wouldn't make much sense
2014-11-30 19:21:57	knod	Yeah
2014-11-30 19:21:59	knod	Hmm
2014-11-30 19:22:15	knod	Not sure how to fit that into how the thing is now. It's interactive.
2014-11-30 19:22:31	knod	Ok, I'll have to think about it
2014-11-30 19:26:28	knod	Other than human readability, what other disadvantages do really really huge files have?

2014-12-01 07:08:09	Brend	So it seems to me that the on-enter action would execute first, and then the FSM would receive the event emitted by the transition, and then it would receive the event emitted by the on-enter
2014-12-01 07:08:54	Brend	On the basis that it should receive events in the order they're emitted, where that's well-defined (which it is here)

2014-12-01 07:10:05	Electro	huh?
2014-12-01 07:10:09	Brend	Okay let's start again
2014-12-01 07:10:12	Brend	You have some FSM.
2014-12-01 07:10:30	Brend	An event comes in, and it runs an action accordingly
2014-12-01 07:10:48	Brend	That action may or may not emit events, and then it may return a next state.
2014-12-01 07:11:04	Brend	If it returns a next state, the FSM should transition to that state before running any more events
2014-12-01 07:11:22	Brend	When it's in a state (rather than busy transitioning), it should receive events in the order they were emitted
2014-12-01 07:11:27	Brend	I don't think there's any ambiguity here

2014-12-01 07:12:23	Electro	there isn't, but I find it weird that you can end up pushing events into being executed on other states, I guess
2014-12-01 07:12:55	Electro	it seems easy to mess up
2014-12-01 07:13:27	Electro	is this what's done, then? just queue the events?
2014-12-01 07:13:54	Electro	(typically, I mean)
2014-12-01 07:13:58	Brend	It's what Erlang's gen_fsm does, which is my basis for this ;)
2014-12-01 07:14:04	Electro	ah
2014-12-01 07:14:28	Electro	that is pretty convincing, then :P
2014-12-01 07:15:00	Brend	So as an example I have a DB connection worker which is an FSM. When started it first a "connect" event itself and then goes into the "connecting" state.
2014-12-01 07:15:24	Brend	Then it receives the connect event and attempts to connect. If that fails, it sets a timer to send itself another "connect" event later, and stays connecting
2014-12-01 07:16:19	Brend	Without being able to fire events at itself, it wouldn't be able to do that timed backoff.
2014-12-01 07:16:44	Electro	it just seems like a dangerous and not-at-all intuitive way of doing AI :P
2014-12-01 07:16:56	Electro	either that or my mathematician side is just being naggy
2014-12-01 07:17:35	Brend	I dunno. I'm taking a nap and I set an alarm clock to wake me up. Then I get woken up by my phone and have to run off and do something, and later the alarm clock fires and I ignore it because my state has changed.
2014-12-01 07:18:16	Electro	heh
2014-12-01 07:18:18	Brend	You should design things so that the flow of events and states isn't deterministic, any more than absolutely necessary. That's the point of FSMs in the first place
2014-12-01 07:19:04	Brend	(If you *do* want a flow to be deterministic, don't model it with events, which are inherently async)
2014-12-01 07:19:38	Electro	why can't everything important be commutative and associative? :P
2014-12-01 07:20:16	Electro	I'm really not sure if this is the nicest approach for unit AI, though
2014-12-01 07:20:18	Brend	They can be if you don't mind having nondeterministic state ; )
2014-12-01 07:20:29	Electro	is there anything else out there that is not behavior trees?
2014-12-01 07:20:35	Electro	behavior trees look like glorified normal code
2014-12-01 07:22:13	Brend	They are, except they're conveniently modelled as data (meaning you can construct and modify them on the fly)
2014-12-01 07:23:01	Electro	Lisp to the rescue
2014-12-01 07:23:50	Brend	DOUBTFUL
2014-12-01 07:24:06	Electro	:P

2014-12-01 18:38:41	adouble	doing some non profit stuff teaching game production too so always keeping my eyes out for a new tool.
2014-12-01 18:39:13	newguise1234	I've been cursed with being interested in c++/opengl, so its been difficult to get interested in mobile stuff.  Thats probably just due to where my mind is and what I read though.

2014-12-01 18:40:00	newguise1234	I had read/heard about that pixel bit you talked about previously though
2014-12-01 18:40:03	newguise1234	thought it was interesting
2014-12-01 18:40:46	adouble	ahh yea i used it with a class of 7th graders - assembled them into mini production teams and had them make a game in about 20 minutes. nothing too deep, but does a great job explaining the building blocks of design

2014-12-01 18:45:53	newguise1234	due to just setting world positions doesn't apply a feedback force on the moved object

2014-12-01 18:46:32	newguise1234	then your movement would be a rotational force applied in some direction
2014-12-01 18:46:43	adouble	ahhh gotcha. i once built a rocket launcher using ray physics

2014-12-02 05:13:27	Brain	is there a 'proper' name for a pair of vectors which indicate position and direction?
2014-12-02 05:13:52	Brain	because i used to think that a vector was simply that: position + direction.... seems that in 3D maths, two of them are needed and im not sure what to name my struct.

2014-12-02 05:19:20	newguise1234	you could say something along the lines of vertex and oriented vertex
2014-12-02 05:19:30	newguise1234	where oriented vertex inherits from vertex
2014-12-02 05:20:23	newguise1234	or just call it oriented vertex and store a position and direction vector in it
2014-12-02 05:21:26	Spark	Brain: transform
2014-12-02 05:21:41	Spark	not necessarily a pair of vectors though
2014-12-02 05:22:02	Spark	but a simple position and direction is a kind of transform
2014-12-02 05:22:57	Spark	in general an affine transformation is a square matrix in whatever space you're dealing with, and there are even more general transforms as well
2014-12-02 05:23:53	Brain	ah thanks
2014-12-02 05:24:21	Brain	OrientedVertex sounds descriptive, but long :p

2014-12-02 05:27:09	newguise1234	the bullet physics library uses btTransform in many places
2014-12-02 05:29:24	Spark	if you need a restricted transform (i.e. not the full power of a general affine transform), you can often save memory by using a special implementation that only stores what you need
2014-12-02 05:29:41	Spark	but then if you're not storing millions of them, you probably don't want to maintain your own

2014-12-02 10:48:07	newguise1234	Earlier today I started implementing an FSM to handle my input after seeing Brend and Electro talking about them.  
2014-12-02 10:49:30	newguise1234	The last section of this http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html has me rethinking my decision.
2014-12-02 10:50:01	newguise1234	any input?
2014-12-02 10:50:23	paultech	Hehe, always thought FSM was a overcomplicated way to explain it
2014-12-02 10:50:57	newguise1234	I mean, really I just implemented a stack that pushes input through to deeper levels if the higher levels don't use that key
2014-12-02 10:51:45	paultech	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Torniqueterevolution.jpg Strong example of FSM
2014-12-02 10:52:04	newguise1234	lol
2014-12-02 10:52:15	paultech	its really how they teach FSM in game dev classes
2014-12-02 10:52:22	paultech	its a excellent FSM
2014-12-02 10:52:51	newguise1234	cool
2014-12-02 10:52:56	paultech	but ya newguise1234, Almost every game would have FSM of some type
2014-12-02 10:53:03	newguise1234	so, via the article, I actually implemented a pushdown automata
2014-12-02 10:53:07	newguise1234	k
2014-12-02 10:53:07	paultech	I'm not sure the point of a stack there
2014-12-02 10:53:20	paultech	it seems a solution without a problem
2014-12-02 10:53:26	newguise1234	it really did clean up my code
2014-12-02 10:53:35	newguise1234	I think I'm just trying to use it for too much now though
2014-12-02 10:54:05	paultech	Ah
2014-12-02 10:55:04	newguise1234	I also abused class templates so I could get around rewriting a 15 line function, but that means I can only have one state per class

2014-12-02 10:56:34	newguise1234	the point of the stack was, I had remembered in some games being able to move around still while in a menu
2014-12-02 10:57:01	newguise1234	and I figured with a stack you could just push input through the stack until you reach a state that handles it
2014-12-02 10:57:38	newguise1234	and when a state is able to handle an input, I mask that one so lower levels don't reuse it

2014-12-02 11:00:06	newguise1234	I think I will end up slowly reworking my code so it works with this state system.
2014-12-02 11:00:23	newguise1234	my worry about that was as said at the end of the article, being able to add ai
2014-12-02 11:00:36	paultech	You could just have two active states for that, stacks are best for transitional states where for some reason you need to know previous and next state in order to transition
2014-12-02 11:00:38	newguise1234	I think it wouldn't restrict an ai's ability to function though
2014-12-02 11:00:41	paultech	that said, if you've got them. nothing wrong with them
2014-12-02 11:00:48	paultech	just not needed for every game

2014-12-02 20:06:02	axion	greetings
2014-12-02 20:06:07	Neurisko	hola
2014-12-02 20:06:16	DragonRift	howe are you guys doing
2014-12-02 20:07:02	axion	I'm doing better than the bugs in my engine. They are dying left and right
2014-12-02 20:07:34	DragonRift	my game team uses Unity3D
2014-12-02 20:08:09	DragonRift	I have been down the engine engineering path before
2014-12-02 20:08:15	DragonRift	I rather use a Unified engine
2014-12-02 20:09:10	DragonRift	the failure of my last team cost be 365k USD so I did not want that again
2014-12-02 20:09:17	DragonRift	cost me
2014-12-02 20:09:30	Neurisko	I like Unity and I like C#.
2014-12-02 20:09:32	Neurisko	ouch
2014-12-02 20:09:43	DragonRift	yea
2014-12-02 20:09:47	DragonRift	so this is why I use Unity now
2014-12-02 20:09:59	DragonRift	I did not want to exhaust resources developing an engine
2014-12-02 20:10:09	axion	I don't like constraints of an engine, and I like learning how to do things on my own
2014-12-02 20:10:35	axion	also, I use a very different language
2014-12-02 20:10:38	DragonRift	axion: I have been making games for 20~ years but have never successfully published anything
2014-12-02 20:10:48	DragonRift	so I chose a unified engine so I can focus on games instead of engines

2014-12-02 20:11:22	axion	I'm more interested in tackling low level design problems engines seem to work around so your toplevel code is mostly a hack
2014-12-02 20:11:25	DragonRift	axion: even if ppl dislike Unity3D, its a pretty solid platform
2014-12-02 20:12:19	DragonRift	axion: I am sure you can understand
2014-12-02 20:13:10	axion	sure, i'm just a 20-year solo developer. nothing professional
2014-12-02 20:13:29	DragonRift	I am a ceo/production manager
2014-12-02 20:13:41	axion	I get more enjoyment out of learning than productivity
2014-12-02 20:14:13	Neurisko	Network engineer and related positions. Writer. Game dev is a pretty recent thing for me, nothing published yet.
2014-12-02 20:14:21	DragonRift	axion: without engine developers, professional developers do not have access to technology
2014-12-02 20:15:12	axion	True, which is part of the reason every game is practically the same thing these days.

2014-12-02 20:16:07	Neurisko	The games with big PR budgets are similar to each other because they sell. Same reason there are remakes and sequels in the movie theaters.

2014-12-02 20:16:32	DragonRift	axion: its true though

2014-12-02 21:11:03	fleshtheworld	the thing is, im not very familiar with setting up IDE, compilers, linkers, etc so if it old and doesnt mention thiese thing i might get lost a bit

2014-12-03 18:39:47	razieliyo	it's something like, I download minecraft from the official webpage, it runs at X speed, then I download from a server I made and uploaded it, it runs faster, I think it has more or less the same sense

2014-12-04 12:39:03	sarseo	i don't think there's anything about that.  every game does those formulas differently.

2014-12-04 12:45:06	njcomsec	but i have outlined the experience system a bit...... each skill will have 10 levels, and it takes 10 minutes to reach first level, 20 after that to reach second level, up to level 9 100 minutes to reach level 10, and each level gives a 10% skill boost, so level 10 will be 200% of level 1
2014-12-04 12:46:39	njcomsec	and i mean x minutes roughly of performing that skill action, but of course there will also be other variabes too....this is just a rough progression outline
2014-12-04 12:47:02	njcomsec	so i can estimate how long it will take a player to reach the endgame

2014-12-04 12:51:09	sarseo	the numbers should be highly irrelevant.  this is what makes a lot of rpg's flawed.  once you break it down to contests, you question what are the rewards and risks involved.

2014-12-04 12:51:55	njcomsec	not sure what you mean
2014-12-04 12:52:12	sarseo	like why does your player want to attack a goblin?  what's their motivation?  is it exp?  is it gold?  what's that worth?  what did it give you?
2014-12-04 12:52:22	sarseo	why is that relevant to killing a goblin?
2014-12-04 12:52:32	njcomsec	yeh for risk and reward
2014-12-04 12:52:38	njcomsec	the numbers determine this
2014-12-04 12:53:00	sarseo	right, but to know what numbers you're going to use, you should analyze and weigh what the player is going to experience.
2014-12-04 12:53:24	njcomsec	ahh i seee i think
2014-12-04 12:53:46	njcomsec	yeh well im trying to use rounded numbers(ones or tens) to make my calculations and analysis of my mechanics easier
2014-12-04 12:53:50	njcomsec	because i havnt done this before
2014-12-04 12:54:01	njcomsec	but you are right the equations are more important 
2014-12-04 12:54:13	sarseo	game systems for rpgs were designed long before video game rpgs came around.  you should look into what inspired those authors to create the games they did, so you can come up with your own unique take.
2014-12-04 12:54:15	njcomsec	im just trying to make some kind of outline i can understand
2014-12-04 12:54:28	njcomsec	yeh
2014-12-04 12:54:42	njcomsec	well iv been trying to get inspiration from modern MMOs, but it seems their formulas are pretty complex
2014-12-04 12:54:57	sarseo	do they need to be?
2014-12-04 12:55:12	njcomsec	i dont know
2014-12-04 12:55:17	sarseo	big part of MMO's is they try to account for the demand for PvP now.  so higher degrees of sophistication are necessary.
2014-12-04 12:55:34	njcomsec	yeh my game is SP only. and for mobiles
2014-12-04 12:55:43	njcomsec	so i guess it needs to be much simpler
2014-12-04 12:55:56	sarseo	it's almost come down to the directly action games now.
2014-12-04 12:56:23	sarseo	and mobile is just a platform
2014-12-04 12:57:12	njcomsec	yeh but it is more casual i guess(quick play sessions on the bus/train)
2014-12-04 12:58:20	njcomsec	ill develop a very simple combat system first and then add on things to that

2014-12-04 15:33:25	BlackFox	One way is to calculate angle that your planet sweeps around the star
2014-12-04 15:33:35	BlackFox	Calculate angle between vectors X and X+V*dt etc
2014-12-04 15:33:38	BlackFox	integrate this angle
2014-12-04 15:33:45	BlackFox	total_angle = angle + delta_angle*dt

2014-12-04 15:36:06	BlackFox	when you start your integration, that'll be the point at which revolution counter goes up by one
2014-12-04 15:36:11	BlackFox	it can be an arbitrary point
2014-12-04 15:36:42	BlackFox	you don't need any original angles or store any positions
2014-12-04 15:36:58	BlackFox	simply find angle between previous position of planet and new position of planet to find change in angle
2014-12-04 15:36:58	BlackFox	also
2014-12-04 15:37:05	sarseo	planets don't really move that fast...
2014-12-04 15:37:07	BlackFox	angle = angle + delta_angle

2014-12-04 15:37:27	sarseo	at least... relatively speaking.
2014-12-04 15:37:27	BlackFox	had a mistake there, no need to multiply by dt since it includes dt already
2014-12-04 15:37:32	BlackFox	sarseo, doesn't matter
2014-12-04 15:37:38	BlackFox	if you're using double precision values, you can still calculate this
2014-12-04 15:38:27	BlueProtoman0	So just keep adding the change in angle across each frame until I get to 2*pi (or 360, since Unity works in degrees)?
2014-12-04 15:38:45	BlackFox	yes
2014-12-04 15:38:46	sarseo	i'm just saying, passengers of planet slingshot should have to pay express transport fees.

2014-12-04 15:39:07	BlackFox	your planet is moving around the sun

2014-12-04 15:42:29	BlackFox	Actually I'm wrong about it being mean anomaly, but nevermind
2014-12-04 15:42:42	BlackFox	for calculating mean anomaly you need to do a little extra step which you shouldn't care about
2014-12-04 15:42:50	BlackFox	the value you have sweeps from 0 to 2*pi after one revolution, that's all that matters
2014-12-04 15:43:05	BlackFox	saying that 'unity works in degrees' is a little silly
2014-12-04 15:43:11	BlackFox	sin(x) always takes radians
2014-12-04 15:43:17	BlackFox	anyone who makes sin(x) take degrees is silly in the head
2014-12-04 15:43:49	BlackFox	would be better to use gradians than degrees

2014-12-04 21:31:46	BlueProtoman	Does it cost money?
2014-12-04 21:31:53	DragonRift	the addon was 25$

2014-12-04 21:32:15	BlueProtoman	I'm not interested in grids
2014-12-04 21:32:32	BlueProtoman	I'm just interested in figuring out when a planet that's orbiting around a star has completed its first revolution
2014-12-04 21:32:53	BlueProtoman	I have planets, I have them gravitating towards a star, I even have them orbiting, I just can't tell exactly when it completes its first orbit
2014-12-04 21:33:40	BlueProtoman	Also, no guarantees as to what the shape of the orbit actually is; it will likely never be perfectly circular or elliptical, though
2014-12-04 21:34:19	DragonRift	my game has Planet orbits in it (standard and eliptical)
2014-12-04 21:35:10	BlueProtoman	Well, my orbits are likely to be neither; it all depends on where the user taps the screen, what direction he pulls, and how far back

2014-12-04 22:07:23	BlueProtoman	newguise1234: Yes
2014-12-04 22:08:02	newguise1234	are you using normalized positions?
2014-12-04 22:08:58	BlueProtoman	I don't follow
2014-12-04 22:09:12	newguise1234	ie. normalized_planet_position = normalize(planet_position-gravity_source_position)
2014-12-04 22:09:37	BlueProtoman	Oh, uh, no, I'm not
2014-12-04 22:09:59	newguise1234	if you do that, you will essentially shove the path into the shape of a circle around the gravity source
2014-12-04 22:10:29	BlueProtoman	So normalizing the coordinates will make it easier?
2014-12-04 22:10:46	newguise1234	you can compute the angle of rotation around the gravity source using sin/cos/tan
2014-12-04 22:10:54	newguise1234	as if you were tracking a point in a circle
2014-12-04 22:11:23	newguise1234	sometimes you'll be taking larger angular steps and sometimes you'll be taking smaller angular steps
2014-12-04 22:11:42	BlueProtoman	This is what I'm doing now http://pastebin.com/G6Gj8Uur
2014-12-04 22:11:45	newguise1234	based on how different the actual planet trajectory is from the circular path
2014-12-04 22:12:27	newguise1234	is the gravity source at (0,0)?

2014-12-04 22:16:19	newguise1234	the concept is, normalizing a vector turns it into a unit vector, essentially giving you purely the ratios between x,y coordinates

2014-12-04 22:19:26	newguise1234	BlueProtoman: do you understand how normalizing it shoves it into a unit vector?
2014-12-04 22:19:43	BlueProtoman	newguise1234: Yes, that's literally the definition of normalization
2014-12-04 22:19:43	newguise1234	I'm pretty sure the Angle function is meant to work between unit vectors
2014-12-04 22:19:51	newguise1234	or at least vectors of the same magnitude

2014-12-04 22:54:44	DragonRift	the problem is even though its advanced
2014-12-04 22:54:47	DragonRift	its not commented
2014-12-04 22:55:03	DragonRift	and its been shelved for almost 10 years
2014-12-04 22:55:46	newguise1234	for some reason I was thinking 2005 was 5 years ago TT___TT
2014-12-04 22:56:17	newguise1234	Understandable with the comments though, I should but probably won't start commenting my code better :/

2014-12-04 22:57:34	DragonRift	we would likely strip out the threading core
2014-12-04 22:57:37	DragonRift	aznd rebuild it
2014-12-04 22:57:41	DragonRift	and release it as a lib
2014-12-04 23:00:25	newguise1234	I think that would be cool.  I don't know the market, but I feel if that were to be out there, it would ease the barrier of entry for getting an mmo up and running
2014-12-04 23:01:06	newguise1234	I don't know much of anything about MaNGOS though, ie. if its a viable library for someone to pick up and use

2014-12-04 23:06:48	DragonRift	the goal was to have a server that could have the number of cores change and adapt
2014-12-04 23:06:50	DragonRift	without rebooting
2014-12-04 23:07:28	DragonRift	that way you could have dyanamic load scaling

2014-12-04 23:15:35	newguise1234	thats unfortunate man, it sounds like you have your shit together though
2014-12-04 23:16:32	newguise1234	thats cool man, you can do some interesting stuff with card mechanics
2014-12-04 23:16:53	newguise1234	ie. they made a pokemon trading card video game
2014-12-04 23:16:56	newguise1234	and it was fun
2014-12-04 23:16:57	newguise1234	lol
2014-12-04 23:16:58	DragonRift	we are more then cards tho
2014-12-04 23:17:06	DragonRift	we have 4 diff game emchanics
2014-12-04 23:17:10	DragonRift	first is CCG
2014-12-04 23:17:10	newguise1234	aye, thats why I'm a bit more interested than I was before
2014-12-04 23:17:25	DragonRift	second is Colony/City Management
2014-12-04 23:17:37	DragonRift	third is top down 4x as a 3D shooter
2014-12-04 23:17:47	DragonRift	and fourth is a slot machine for mining
2014-12-04 23:19:07	newguise1234	haha, post-apocolyptic revitalize LasVegas with card play as a core mechanic?
2014-12-04 23:19:08	DragonRift	all done as a multiplayer online game
2014-12-04 23:19:08	newguise1234	:p
2014-12-04 23:19:33	DragonRift	well expeditions and missions are card based
2014-12-04 23:19:41	DragonRift	territory controla nd conquest are shooter
2014-12-04 23:20:55	DragonRift	the entire space section is content expansion between alpha and beta
2014-12-04 23:21:31	DragonRift	so the alpha is 2 main game mechanics

2014-12-04 23:23:06	DragonRift	persistant
2014-12-04 23:23:32	newguise1234	cool, its making me think of this other game that dealt with territories/control
2014-12-04 23:23:35	DragonRift	when your colony is destroyed
2014-12-04 23:23:41	DragonRift	your moved to a new blank planet
2014-12-04 23:23:50	newguise1234	it has 3 factions in a large mmo war, if you know what I'm talking about
2014-12-04 23:23:55	newguise1234	cool

2014-12-04 23:25:11	DragonRift	old colony is destroyed
2014-12-04 23:25:32	DragonRift	so you only ever have one planet
2014-12-04 23:25:40	DragonRift	now rather then Invading someone
2014-12-04 23:25:44	DragonRift	you can RAID them

2014-12-05 00:26:45	paultech	You can't trust or rely on the vertex/index information used in the Hullshape to feed your rendering, that is asking for trouble in a huge way!
2014-12-05 00:27:10	newguise1234	I recompute the hull every frame I want the debugging information
2014-12-05 00:27:25	paultech	Nah man, Bullet has a debug interface for drawing
2014-12-05 00:27:29	paultech	Use that

2014-12-05 00:27:46	newguise1234	right now my btGhostObject's hull shape does match what my boxes are bouncing off of
2014-12-05 00:27:50	newguise1234	mm k
2014-12-05 00:27:56	paultech	ya by sheer luck I promise you
2014-12-05 00:28:38	paultech	You create a object thats too be rendered, you defined its shape in the GL world, you then define its shape to the physical world. The object in the GL world can be thought of a pin up thats constantly tacked/moved to its position in the physical world

2014-12-05 00:29:28	paultech	Bullet can do many optimizations in the physical world that alters the index and vertex buffers that makes them not suitable for rendering 
2014-12-05 00:29:29	newguise1234	and using that info with positioning offsets and the such
2014-12-05 00:29:32	paultech	Gotcha you just need debug?
2014-12-05 00:29:35	newguise1234	yeah
2014-12-05 00:30:48	paultech	http://hastebin.com/rafudazaki.cpp Make a class like that, filling in the blanks and picking our own name
2014-12-05 00:31:04	paultech	You can then create a instance of it, pass it to bullet and it'll draw for you each frame for debugging
2014-12-05 00:31:21	paultech	it'll show collision points etc, You can define what info you want drawn (AABB, Spheres, lines etc)

2014-12-05 00:31:42	newguise1234	oh very nice
2014-12-05 00:31:51	paultech	So much more flexible way to get your debugging but again, only for debugging. Bullet and rendering world should only ever sync not intertwine
2014-12-05 00:32:35	paultech	It also allows you to separate the rendering the simulation loop in order to get out of lock step? IE someone with a faster frame rate really should not run faster than someone else 
2014-12-05 00:32:44	paultech	If you tie in rendering and physics, you get that problem
2014-12-05 00:33:05	newguise1234	makes sense
2014-12-05 00:33:30	newguise1234	I still need to add threading to my program, but I think my stuff isn't intertwined
2014-12-05 00:34:02	newguise1234	I just added a globject constructor that copies vertices/indices from a btHullShape into a vbo ibo
2014-12-05 00:34:12	newguise1234	I will look into using the debugging interface instead though
2014-12-05 00:34:20	paultech	ah ya, this doesn't even need threading. Bullet by default will even handle the fixed timestep for you so you dont have to worry about above problem so long as you dont go out of your way to get to get vertex information from bullet
2014-12-05 00:34:36	paultech	gotcha ya, I do recommend it. its a flexible way to do it
2014-12-05 00:35:17	newguise1234	I had this fun bug where setLocalScaling was being set to a 0.0f value
2014-12-05 00:35:37	newguise1234	and that ended up breaking the object somehow
